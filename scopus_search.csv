One way of operationalizing segmentability is through the relative frequency of a complex word to its base word. However, relative frequency has failed to affect duration for different affix categories in many previous studies. One potential reason is the fact that complex words vary in their prosodic structure, depending on the prosodic integration of the affix (Plag & Ben Hedia, 2018). In a large corpus study with three different corpora and eight affixes each, we investigate how prosodic word structure and relative frequency influence duration, and how these two factors interact. We find that prosodic structure does not significantly interact with relative frequency. Second, we show that relative frequency effects on duration do not emerge consistently across a large number of affixes. Third, not only does prosodic word structure not explain the absence of relative frequency effects, it also often cannot account for durational differences as such. We discuss these findings in light of phonological theory and speech production models. © 2022 The Author(s).

Recent findings, however, call this tri-partite epenthesis pattern into question: First, several studies suggest that this epenthesis pattern is not true in the realm of perception and is not completely regular in production, and second, the relevant phonotactic restrictions seem to be weakening even outside of epenthesis contexts. This paper therefore investigates the extent to which the spontaneous choice of epenthetic vowels in the production of Japanese conforms to the traditional tri-partite pattern. Epenthesis was induced by presenting pseudo-word stimuli of the form of [aCCa] (C = a voiced consonant) to subjects orthographically. The findings suggest that indeed, the production pattern does not fully conform to what is generally reported for nativized loanwords; in particular, the traditionally “default” vowel [M] is used by our participants frequently in all contexts, including the two where [o] or [i] is usually reported. That said, we also show that there is considerable variability across speakers as to which vowel is epenthesized, especially in the palatal context, and this variability includes tokens of vowels similar to all possible lexical vowels of Japanese. © 2019 The Author(s).

Our purpose is to evaluate the hypothesis that prominence production displays a cumulative relation between acoustic and kinematic dimensions of spoken language, especially focusing on the clustering of gestures (head, eyebrows), at the same time asking if lexical-prosodic features would interfere with this cumulative relation. Our materials comprise 12 minutes of speech from Swedish television news presentations. The results reveal a significant trend for larger fo rises when a head movement accompanies the accented word, and even larger when an additional eyebrow movement is present. This trend is observed for accentual rises that encode phrase-level prominence, but not for accentual falls that are primarily related to lexical prosody. Moreover, the trend is manifested differently in different lexical-prosodic categories (Accent 1 versus Accent 2 with one versus two lexical stresses). The study provides novel support for a cumulative-cue hypothesis and the assumption that prominence production is essentially multimodal, well in line with the idea of speech and gesture as an integrated system. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

We examine the role of prior experience in phonotactic learning. Talkers who differ in their language background are more likely to vary in their phonotactic grammars than talkers who share a language variety. This predicts stronger adaptation to novel phonotactics when listeners are exposed to multiple talkers from different versus shared language backgrounds. We tested this by exposing listeners to two talkers, each of whom exhibited a different phonotactic constraint, in a recognition memory task. In Experiment 1, English listeners exposed to talkers differing in language background (English versus French) showed a greater degree of adaptation relative to cases where the talkers shared a language background (English or French). Experiment 2 found similar results when English listeners were exposed to talkers from different, non-native language backgrounds (Hindi versus Hungarian), suggesting that listeners make fine-grained distinctions between different non-native language phonotactics. These results suggest that phonotactic adaptation is flexible, but constrained by the fine-grained causal inferences listeners draw from their prior experience. Copyright: © 2021 The Author(s).

In sign languages, this type of knowledge is scarcely documented. The current study compares an error-driven measure and a model-driven measure of complexity for signs in French Sign Language (LSF). The former measure is based on error rates of handshape, location, orientation, movement, and sign fluidity in a repetition task administered to non-signers; the latter measure is derived by applying a feature-geometry model of sign description to the same set of signs. A significant correlation is found between the two measures for the overall complexity. When looking at the effects of individual phonological classes on complexity, a significant correlation is found for handshape and location but not for movement. We discuss how these results indicate that a fine-grained theoretical model of sign phonology/phonetics reflects the degree of complexity as resulting from the perceptual and articulatory properties of signs. © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","Open Library of Humanities","18686346","","","","English","Lab.

Data were obtained from 102 L1 Japanese speakers in the J-AESOP corpus, which also includes nativelikeness judgments by trained phoneticians. Spectrally, speakers judged to be non-nativelike showed a strong influence from L1 categories, except L2 // which could be deflected away from L1 /a/ according to SLM(-r) and L2 // which seemed orthographically assimilated to L1 /o/ according to PAM(-L2). More nativelike speakers showed vowel spectra similar to those of native English speakers across all vowels, in accordance with L2LP. Temporally, although speakers tended to equate the phonetic length of English vowels with Japanese phonemic length distinctions, segment-level L1-L2 category similarity was not a significant predictor of the speakers’ nativelikeness. Instead, the implementation of prosodic-level factors such as stress and phrase-final lengthening were better predictors. The results highlight the importance of suprasegmental factors in successful category learning and also reveal a weakness in current models of L2 speech acquisition, which focus primarily on the segmental level.

This also happens in Maltese, even though the glottal stop here also occurs as a phoneme, so that the epenthetic glottal stop may significantly alter which other words the vowel-initial word is similar to. For the pair attur/at:ur/versus qattus/?at:us/(English 'actor' versus 'cat'), adding an epenthetic glottal stop to the vowel-initial word renders the two words more similar. This provides an interesting test bed for the hypothesis of audience design. If speakers want to highlight the contrast between the two words, they should, in contrast to what usually happens when a word is prominent, not produce an epenthetic glottal stop. We tested this in a production experiment and found that speakers instead produce much more glottal stops for such vowel-initial words under a phonological contrast compared with a given version, and even slightly more than when under a lexical contrast (e.g., actor versus theatre).

At initial stages of foreign language exposure, learners rely on position-specific phonetic detail more than native speakers or advanced learners, thus mappings according to prosodic and phonotactic context are a crucial factor in early interlanguage phonological development. In a perceptual assimilation experiment, we manipulated syllable position (onset vs. coda) and phonotactic complexity (simple vs. complex codas) in phonotactically similar languages for auditory presentation of six German obstruents (i.e., familiar [h k ] and novel [ç x pf͡]) to native speakers of American English who had no previous exposure to German. By means of weighted proportions (Park & de Jong, 2008) and overlap scores (Levy, 2009), we found that [h k pf͡] mapped categorically to English orthographic categories <h>, <k>, <sh>, and <f>, respectively, in all positions, whereas the novel fricatives [ç x] exhibited distinct mapping patterns from each other, from other sounds, and according to syllable position.

Listeners can use lexical information to categorize sounds and recognize words, but systematic variation may act to neutralize lexical contrasts. Additionally, the detail in the phonological-lexical representations may vary along with linguistic experience. We examine the confluence of these factors in the current study, examining how lexical competition structures phonetic variation of merging vs. non-merging tone categories in Cantonese-English bilinguals varying in relative Cantonese vs. English dominance. Listeners categorized tokens from lexical tone continua generated from minimal pairs (Experiment 1: Word identification) and from word-nonword pairs (Experiment 2: Lexical decision). When there are lexical competitors at both endpoints of the continua, listeners maintained more discrete categorization functions for non-merging tones than merging tones. In the absence of lexical competition, there was no difference in response functions for merging and non-merging tones at the group level. English-dominant early Cantonese-English bilinguals consistently showed less sigmoidal response functions compared to Cantonese-dominant early bilinguals in both experiments suggesting that lexical representations may be stored with less precise tonal detail by English-dominant Cantonese speakers. Overall, these data suggest that the presence of a lexical competitor constrains the range of acceptable phonetic variation for non-merging tones, while listeners are more accepting of phonetic variation in the merging tone categories. © 2023 Ubiquity Press.

We established patterns of within-accent vowel confusions, and then explored cross-accent perception, assessing how listeners from one accent background categorize vowels from another. Our experimental task required mapping continuous phonetic dimensions to perceptual categories in the absence of phonotactic and lexical cues to vowel identity and socio-indexical information about the talker. Our results show that, without these sources of information, there is uncertainty in vowel categorization, even for native accent vowels, and that this degree of uncertainty increases for unfamiliar accents. The patterns of cross-accent perception largely reflect the accent-specific perceptual structure of the listener, as opposed to adaptations to the stimulus accents. This finding contrasts with the type of active talker adaptation found with tasks offering lexical information about vowel identity and indexical information about the talker. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","J.A.

The label is directly linked to the loss of consonantal constriction observed in this process, but it also implicitly signals a specific type of change affecting manner of articulation from consonant to vowel, which involves loss of tongue lateralization, the defining property of lateral sounds. In this study, we consider two potential diachronic pathways of change: an abrupt loss of lateralization which follows from the loss of apical constriction, versus slower gradual loss of lateralization that tracks the articulatory changes to the dorsal component of /l/. We present articulatory data from seven speakers of New Zealand English, acquired using a combination of midsagittal and lateral EMA, as well as midsagittal ultrasound. Different stages of sound change are reconstructed through synchronic variation between light, dark, and vocalized /l/, induced by systematic manipulation of the segmental and morphosyntactic environment, and complemented by comparison of different individual articulatory strategies. Our data show a systematic reduction in lateralization that is conditioned by increasing degrees of /l/-darkening and /l/-vocalization. This observation supports the idea of a gradual diachronic shift and the following pathway of change: /l/-darkening, driven by the dorsal gesture, precipitates some loss of lateralization, which is followed by loss of the apical gesture. This pathway indicates that loss of lateralization is an integral component in the changes in manner of articulation of /l/ from consonantal to vocalic. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

TM speakers often merge the two sibilants through deretroflexion of the retroflex category. The results of the reading task showed that the variation is on a full continuum, from a complete merger to clear contrasts, and the merger is more prevalent among male speakers, demonstrating the impact of the social stigma associated with the merger. However, the results of the interactive task demonstrated that speakers who merged the contrast produced the retroflex sounds as distinct from their alveolar counterparts, revealing hidden structures in the mental lexicon. The mismatch between the abstract phonological knowledge and actual implementation in production suggests that the exposure to phonological systems of other speakers, especially those who make clear distinctions, has led to the incorporation of discrete categories into the phonological knowledge of the merged speakers. These findings suggest that large individual variation in the early stages of sound change may provide evidence for possible categories in a given language for language learners; however, their implementation may be further modulated by social as well as other phonetic factors. © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","Open Library of Humanities","18686346","","","","English","Lab.

Danish is an aspiration language, but the aspirated stops/p t k/are produced with shorter closure duration and less articulatory effort than the unaspirated stops/b d g/. Furthermore, all Danish stops are characterized by some degree of glottal spreading during the closure. In this study, we use a corpus of Danish spontaneous speech (DanPASS) to investigate the intervocalic voicing-its distribution across the two laryngeal categories, whether it patterns as a lenition phenomenon, and whether the aerodynamic environment predicts its distribution. We find that intervocalic voicing is not the norm for either set of stops and is particularly rare in/p t k/. Voiced tokens are mostly found in environments associated with lenition. We suggest that the glottal spreading gesture found in all Danish stops is a phonological mechanism blocking voicing, which is probabilistically lost in spontaneous speech. This predicts our results better than relying on laryngeal features like [voice] or [spread glottis]. The study fills a gap in our knowledge of Danish phonetics and phonology, and is also one of the most extensive corpus studies of intervocalic stop voicing in an 'aspiration language'. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

The present study examines the possibility of investigating linguistic rhythm using movement-based paradigms. Informed by the theory and methods of sensorimotor synchronization, we developed two finger-tapping tasks (synchronization and reproduction), and tested them with English participants. The synchronization task required participants to tap along with the beat of a looped sentence while the reproduction task asked them to tap out the perceived beat patterns after listening to a sentence loop. The results showed that both tasks engaged participants in period tracking of a beat-like structure in the linguistic stimuli, though synchronization did so to a greater extent. Patterns obtained in the reproduction task tended to converge toward participants' spontaneous tapping rates and showed a degree of regularization. Data collected in the synchronization task displayed a consistent anchoring of taps with the vowel onsets. Overall, synchronization performance with language resembled many well-established findings of sensorimotor synchronization with metronome and music. We conclude that our setting of the sensorimotor synchronization paradigm-finger tapping along with looped spoken phrases-is a valid experimentation tool for studying rhythm perception in language. © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

Intuitively, one would expect intonation to play only a small role in expressing communicative functions. However, experimental studies with Vietnamese native speakers show that intonation contours vary across different contexts and are used to mark certain types of information, for example, focus (Jannedy, 2007). In non-tonal languages (e.g., English), the marking of focus by intonation can influence the processing of focus alternatives (Fraundorf, Watson, & Benjamin, 2010). If Vietnamese also uses intonation to mark focus, the question arises whether the behavioral consequences of prosodic focus marking in Vietnamese are comparable to languages such as English or German. To test this, we replicate a study on memory for focus alternatives, originally carried out in German (Koch & Spalek, in progress), with Vietnamese language stimuli. In the original study, memory for focus alternatives was improved in a delayed recall task for focused elements produced with contrastive intonation in female speakers. Here, we replicate this finding with Northern Vietnamese native speakers: Contrastive intonation seems to improve later recall for focus alternatives in Northern Vietnamese, but only for female participants, in line with the findings by Koch and Spalek (in progress). These results indicate that prosodic focus marking in Vietnamese makes alternatives to the focused element more salient. Copyright: © 2020 The Author(s).

The first section addresses a controversy in cognitive neuroscience about the extent to which data from neurological patients can enrich research in cognitive science at all. It introduces post-stroke apraxia of speech (AOS) as a clinical model of a process termed speech motor planning, suggesting that speech data from patients with AOS can inform phonetic theories about articulatory control. The second section explains how speech error data from patients with AOS were used to develop a measure of articulatory ease that integrates facilitating and complicating factors across different phonological levels, from the articulatory gesture to the phonological word. Section 3 presents previously unpublished data to exemplify how this model can be applied to typical speech, e.g., in studies investigating interactions between lexical and articulatory parameters or in developmental studies of word learning.

However, such a goal requires refined measurements of speech articulation (e.g., from the tongue), which are difficult to obtain from young children. In recent years though, technological advances have allowed developmental researchers to make significant steps in that direction. For instance, movements of the tongue, an articulator that is essential for spoken language, can now be tracked and recorded in children with ultrasound imaging. This technique has opened novel research avenues in (a)typical language acquisition, enabling researchers to reliably capture what has long remained invisible in the speech of young children. Within this context, we have designed an experimental platform for the recording and the processing of kinematic data: SOLLAR (Sonographic and Optical Linguo-Labial Articulatory Recording system). The method has been tailored for children, but it is suitable for adults. In the present article, we introduce the recording environment developed to record over 100 children and 30 adults within SOLLAR. We then describe SOLLAR's data processing framework, providing examples of data visualization and a summary of strengths and limitations. Copyright: © 2020 The Author(s).

We examine a tonal register contrast in two Chinese Wu dialects signaled by three cues: pitch height, voice quality, and pitch contour. We found that 1) at the group level, cue weights are context-specific, i.e., vary by tone, and some contrasts rely more heavily on multiple cues than others; 2) dialectal experience affects listeners' perceptual strategy: Shanghai listeners, with their own dialect having a smaller voice quality distinction, do not rely more on the cue even when listening to stimuli with a clear breathy-modal distinction, comparing to Jiashan listeners; 3) individuals' cue weights are correlated in a positive manner, meaning that some listeners show overall larger cue weights than others; larger variability is found when the contrast has more than one salient cue, in which case individuals have different options of choosing one cue over another as the primary cue and this can work against the positive correlation.

This study attempts to replicate several perceptual effects that depend on different aspects of the acoustic signal, testing whether requiring participants to pass two commonly used headphone checks (Huggins pitch perception, Milne et al., 2021; dichotic loudness perception, Woods, Siegel, Traer, & McDermott, 2017) impacts the results or the sample population being used. Participants who pass the Huggins check exhibit a larger effect of spectral tilt on perceived vowel duration, but no other effects were strengthened by either headphone check. Headphone checks actually resulted in a weaker effect of coda voicing on perceived vowel duration. A look at who is excluded by the headphone checks shows that both of them produce exclusions that are imbalanced by participants’ age, gender, education, and geographic region. These imbalanced exclusions have the potential to impact experimental results in a range of ways. Thus, while headphone checks are likely to be valuable for some types of experiments, for others they might have unintended effects, and for many studies they are unlikely to have any substantial effect on the results. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","C.

We tested how German learners of English use in perception two phonetic cues to this contrast in English: the duration of the vowel preceding the stop and the partial glottalization of this vowel. While a longer vowel cues the voiced sound of the contrast, glottalization enhances the voiceless sound, which should be 'easy' for learners as word-finally it is the default in German. We asked whether cueing the 'easy' sound would nevertheless affect learners' word identification. Learners categorized two English minimal pairs along vowel duration continua with either a fully modal vowel or the last 25% of the vowel glottalized. Learners gave more voiced-stop responses as vowel duration increased. They also used glottalization by giving fewer voiced-stop responses for the glottalized continua. A second experiment demonstrated that the glottalization was not merely perceived as a change in the vowel+closure duration ratio. When the glottalized portion of the vowels was set to silence learners gave even fewer voiced-stop responses than in the glottalized condition. Results suggest that learners can use a phonetic cue to a second language sound contrast even if it enhances the familiar 'easy' sound. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, experimental work has demonstrated on a number of occasions that 'transparent' vowels actually undergo harmony (e.g., Gick, Pulleyblank, Campbell, & Mutaka, 2006), re-establishing the role of locality in the analysis of harmony. Existing work on backness harmony in Uyghur argues that /i/ is transparent to harmony, with some proposing that this falls out from the absence of contrastive /w/ in the language (e.g., Vaux, 2000). This paper examines the distribution of surface [i] and [w] within roots and suffixes to assess their phonological status, as well as their participation in harmony. Results support the case that there are no long-distance dependencies in Uyghur, suggesting that harmony is truly local in the language. Results for root-internal [i] and [w] are less clear; evidence from most speakers supports an allophonic relationship, while some evidence for other speakers suggests the possibility of contrastive /i/ and /w/. © 2021 The Author(s).","Contrast; Locality; Transparency; Uyghur; Vowel harmony","","A.G.

This study investigates whether such difficulty derives, at least in part, from an obstacle encountered during perceptual processing: reduced perceptual sensitivity to stress distinctions. Participants were adult L1 English L2 Spanish learners of various proficiency levels. The experiment was a categorical matching task with triads of auditory stimuli minimally contrasting in stress (target) or segmental composition (baseline), an ABX task. The results show that learners were more accurate in the baseline condition than in the target condition, suggesting reduced perceptual sensitivity to stress relative to other contrasts. The reduction in accuracy, however, was restricted to trials in which matching items were not adjacent, further suggesting an obstacle with phonological processing in working memory rather than perceptual categorization. The default stress processing routines of L1 English L2 Spanish learners, optimized for their L1 (not their L2), may be responsible for their acquisitional obstacles with this feature of the Spanish language. © 2023 Ubiquity Press.

Pragmatic information, however, comes in many forms. Using a Visual World Paradigm, tracking listeners' categorical responses and the time-course of information integration via eye movements, we investigated whether and how a different kind of pragmatic information, the contrastive function of prenominal adjectives (Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers, & Carlson, 1999), can affect listeners' perception of voicing in initial plosives. Our results suggest that the pragmatic contrast inference did not affect the behavioral judgments on phonetic categorization, but it did have an (albeit limited) influence during the online processing of voice onset time (VOT). Our findings suggest that different kinds of higher-level pragmatic inferences are not uniform in how (successfully) they are integrated with low-level phonetic properties in real-time comprehension. © 2019 The Author(s).

To test the generalizability of this relationship, this study compares community- and individual-level variation across three long-standing consonant mergers in Hong Kong Cantonese speakers: [n]→[l], [ŋ̩]→[m̩], and [ŋ]↔Ø. Concurrently, we document these understudied mergers in a community that has undergone rapid social change in recent decades. Younger (college-aged) and older (middle-aged) Hong Kongers completed a reading production task followed by a forced-choice lexical identification perception task. Group-level results suggest mismatching production and perception: While the community overall distinguished merger pairs in production, younger listeners are more perceptually categorical than older listeners. However, aggregate results obscure the fact that individuals vary substantially in the extent of merging in both perception and production, including many who exhibit complete merger, and that individual-level production-perception correlations were found for [n]→[l] and [ŋ̩]→[m̩], though not [ŋ]↔Ø.

However, the mechanism or mechanisms that underlie these effects are still unclear. This paper presents data on a new aspect of predictability in speech, namely how it affects allophonic variation. We examine two coronal stop allophones in English, flap and glottal stop, and find that their relationship with predictability is quite different from what is expected under current theories of probabilistic reduction in speech. Flapping is more likely when the word that follows is more predictable, but is not influenced by the frequency of the word itself, while glottal stops are more likely in words that are less predictable. We propose that the crucial distinction between these two allophones is how they are conditioned by phonological context. This, we argue, interacts with online speech planning processes and gives rise to variability for context-dependent allophones. This hypothesis offers a specific, testable mechanism for certain predictability effects, and has the potential to extend to other factors that contribute to variability in speech. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Following previous work, we claim that the voiceless stops in American English involve a glottal constriction gesture to produce voicelessness in coda position, which contrasts with the glottal spreading gesture used in onset position. If the oral stop closure is not audibly produced, or if the oral and glottal gestures are not aligned, the resulting articulation may be perceived as a glottal stop or as pre-glottalized. This study explores the pre-consonantal phonological environments where coda glottal stops occur in a large corpus of American English speech from central Ohio. Coda /t/ glottalization is found near-categorically before sonorants, often phrase-medially before labial and velar obstruents, often phrase-finally, and occasionally elsewhere. We argue that most of this distribution can be explained by phonetic conditions which either favor reduction of the oral closure, or else reinforce the irregular voicing associated with the glottal constriction gesture. However, the near-categorical rate of glottalization before sonorants, as well as somewhat higher rates for younger and female speakers, may not have a plausible coarticulatory source: These suggest that the process is also phonologically planned under some circumstances.

First, we conduct a production study. The TED Talk speech samples are analyzed for relationships between (1) phonological pitch accent, (2) acoustic prosodic features, and (3) information structure, modeled here in terms of referential and lexical givenness as well as focus related to semantic alternatives. Second, we conduct a perception study. Word-level prominence ratings obtained from untrained listeners are analyzed for the effects of these (1) phonological, (2) acoustic, and (3) information structural factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate the interaction of the three kinds of factors on prominence ratings with speech that is fully contextualized, allowing for information about the speaker, the situational context, and the discourse context to interact with and possibly mediate signal-based cues to prominence. Results from the production analysis show a weak probabilistic relation between pitch accent assignment and information structure for these TED Talk speakers, but only in the presence versus absence of pitch accent with differences between lexical and referential information status. No systematic relationship is found between a word’s phonological pitch accent type and information structure category, though we do find some evidence of the expected gradient variation in the acoustic expression of prominence: Words that are more informative tend to have higher pitch and a wider pitch range. Despite the weak association between signal-based prominence and information structure in production, listeners perceive and rate prominence in a manner that is, to varying degrees, in accordance with the Accentual Prominence and Givenness hierarchies. In sum, the findings contribute new evidence of the mediating effects of contextual factors relating to the phonological status of pitch accents, information structure, and speech style on the interpretation of acoustic cues to prominence. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","S.

Tilsen and Cohn (2016) showed that differences in judgments correlate with differences in production, supporting their hypothesis that meta-phonological judgments and speech motor control share a common representation. In the present study, we further propose that syllable count judgments are related to subsegmental representation in the rime, and are independent of acoustic duration. We test the hypothesis by comparing English and German, chosen for their similar word structures and vowel length contrast, and their crucial difference in the gestural specification of coda liquids. In English, coda liquids have an earlier vocalic gesture relative to the consonantal one, while in German, both gestures are simultaneous. We stipulated that sesquisyllabic (over-one) judgments are related to the count of sequentially-timed vocalic gestures in the rime. The difference in the coda liquid composition between the two languages predicts that sesquisyllables should not emerge in German. Our predictions were confirmed by the results of parallel production (acoustic) and syllable count judgment experiments in English and German. We propose a model accounting for these results, and we discuss its typological implications and its limitations. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

We present a perception experiment in which we manipulated pitch span within the nuclear configuration (both nuclear accent and boundary tone) to predict degree of perceived positive bias (i.e., expected positive answer) to yes-no question stimuli. Our results show that a wider pitch span within the nuclear region predicts a higher degree of perceived positive bias, while negative bias is predicted by narrow pitch span. Crucially, though, two interacting sources of listener variability were uncovered, i.e., prolonged exposure to a non-native dialect as well as degree of empathy (i.e., Empathy Quotient, EQ). Exposure to non-native phonological systems was found to affect the way pitch span is mapped onto perceived epistemic bias, through category interference, though mediated by EQ levels. Specifically, high-empathy listeners were more affected by degree of non-native dialect exposure. EQ scores were hence found to have an effect on gradual span manipulation by interacting with the dialect exposure effect. These results advance our understanding of the intonation-meaning mapping by taking into account both the impact of gradual phonetic cues on meaning processing as well as uncovering sources of cognitive variability at the perceiver's level. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Focus marking helps listeners identify the new information, and reject false alternatives to it; while presupposed information is not expected to be falsified. It is not yet clear, however, what cues listeners use to identify the focus, beyond prosodic prominence; e.g., syntactic clefting or word position, given final objects have been previously found to have a default focus bias, even without overt focus marking. We report two speeded false alternative rejection experiments, in Chinese and English, which looked at how prosodic prominence, clefting, and default focus affect encoding of referents in discourse. It was found that, in both languages, prosodic cues facilitated encoding, though this effect was stronger in Chinese. In both languages, clefting played an inhibitory rather than facilitatory role and there was a clear positional default focus bias. This research establishes cross-linguistic similarities and differences in the role of prosodic prominence, clefting, and phrase position in encoding discourse information in Chinese and English. The results suggest language-specific weighting of these cues. Copyright: © 2020 The Author(s).

Assimilation can be viewed as a reduction or loss of the assimilation target's place cue (/n/ in ten), and simultaneously as an enhancement of the assimilation trigger's place cue (/b/ in bucks) by spreading its place cue earlier in the signal. A message-oriented phonological approach predicts that assimilation is sensitive to the relative contextual inferrability of both the target and trigger words: More assimilation should be observed for more contextually predictable target words, while less assimilation should be observed for contextually more predictable trigger words. These predictions deviate from accounts that view assimilation solely as reduction. To test these predictions, sequences which license assimilation were extracted from a conversational speech corpus. Both categorical assimilation (based on close phonetic transcription) and gradient acoustic assimilation (based on F2) were analyzed. As predicted, assimilation was more likely both when a target like ten was high in predictability and when its trigger bucks was low in predictability. Assimilation thus serves as both reduction and enhancement, and can be used to manage redundancy in the speech signal.

In a corpus study, we found that, independent of syllable type, T2 (rising) and T3 (falling-rising) gaps were over-represented, whereas T1 (high level) and T4 (falling) gaps were under-represented. We also observed fewer T1 gaps with voiceless onsets and more T2 and T3 gaps with voiceless onsets, a pattern that is consistent with cross-linguistic observations. While these trends were generally reflected in a wordlikeness rating experiment by Mandarin listeners, their judgements of these gaps, similar to those of real words, were also guided by neighborhood density. Furthermore, T2 gaps with real-word T3 counterparts were rated as more wordlike, a result attributed to the T3 sandhi in Mandarin Chinese. Finally, we used harmonic scores generated from the UCLA Phonotactic Learner to explicitly test the role of lexical knowledge and markedness constraints in modeling speakers’ tonotactic knowledge reflected in the wordlikeness ratings. We found that grammars induced from lexical data were the most successful at predicting wordlikeness ratings of gaps and lexical syllables combined. However, when focused on the ratings of tonotactic gaps, grammars with markedness constraints informed by cross-linguistic observations were more successful even without the constraints being weighted on lexical data. The results show how lexical knowledge and universal markedness, which is not entirely learnable from the lexicon, may account for some tonotactic generalizations. © 2023 Ubiquity Press.

This makes it necessary to examine the interplay of phonetic properties of the denasalized and the three oral stop series as a whole, in synchrony and diachrony. What are their concomitant and conflicting properties? Our study provides a bigger picture of the laryngeal contrast in Seoul and Gyeonggi Korean by examining the acoustic distributions related to the laryngeal properties of the four stop series, using acoustic and electroglottographic data. VOT and f0 play important roles in the distinction of the four stop series, in line with previous studies. While the contribution of voice quality is relatively minor, we show that it plays an essential role of disambiguation when the VOT–f0 space gets crowded: When lenis stops can be confused with other stops, there is an enhancement of breathy voice. Finally, we discuss stop variation according to prosodic contexts. We highlight the basis of both syntagmatic variation and paradigmatic contrast in their phonetic implementations. They illustrate a constant reorganization to reconcile contrast maintenance with constraints from articulatory and perceptual systems, as well as language-specific structures. © 2021 The Author(s).","Breathy voice; Denasalization; Electroglottograph; F<sub>0</sub>; Korean; Laryngeal contrast; Voice quality; VOT","","J.

For the most part, however, this evidence comes from socially homogeneous speech communities where the targeted pattern of variation is mostly socially neutral. What implications might socially structured phonetic variation in the speech community have for the perception-production link? If listeners can predict the phonetic patterns of a talker based on the talker's actual or assumed identity, would they adjust their perceptual strategies accordingly, possibly weakening the link between their own production and perception patterns? This study reports the results of a pair of experiments that investigate the production and perception of coarticulatory vowel nasalization in Afrikaans, a language for which variation in coarticulatory nasalization is socially structured. Relying on nasal airflow measures, the production experiment showed that speakers of White Afrikaans produce more extensive coarticulatory nasalization than speakers of Kleurling Afrikaans. The perception experiment used an eye-tracking paradigm to assess listeners' perceptual reliance on coarticulatory nasalization, and found (i) that Afrikaans speakers' use of coarticulatory nasalization in production predicts their perceptual reliance on this information, (ii) that they rapidly adjust to the coarticulatory timing patterns in the speech of other speakers, but also (iii) that they do not adjust their perceptual reliance on coarticulation in response to the assumed identity of the speaker. The link between perception and production therefore persists, even in this situation of socially structured variation in coarticulatory timing. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

In this paper, we apply a machine learning method, random forest classification (Breiman, 2001), to automate coding (categorical prediction) of two English sociophonetic variables traditionally treated as categorical, non-prevocalic /r/ and word-medial intervocalic /t/, based on tokens' acoustic signatures. We found good performance for binary classifiers of non-prevocalic /r/ (Absent versus Present) and medial /t/ (Voiced versus Voiceless), but not for medial /t/ with a six-way coding distinction (largely due to some codes being sparsely represented in the training data). This method also yields rankings of acoustic measures in terms of importance in classification. Beyond any individual measures, this method generates probabilistic predictions of variation (classifier probabilities) that represent a composite of the acoustic cues fed into the model. In a listening experiment, we found that not only did classifier probabilities significantly capture gradience in trained listeners' perceptions of rhoticity, they better predicted listeners' perceptions than individual acoustic measures. This method thus represents a new approach to reconciling the categorical and continuous dimensions of sociophonetic variation. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

The current production study probes this hypothesis by exploring the relationship between tonal language usage and the acoustic correlates of the register distinction in Kuy, a Katuic language, as spoken in a quadrilingual (Kuy, Thai, Lao, Khmer) Kuy community in Northeast Thailand. The results demonstrate greater persistence of fundamental frequency (f0) differences over the course of the vowel alongside more tonal language experience for male speakers; however, analysis of individual differences finds that H1*−H2*, a correlate of voice quality, is the primary cue for male speakers with greater tonal language experience. For female speakers, a tradeoff is found between f0 and voice quality cues alongside tonal language experience at both the group and individual levels. These findings provide evidence for a model by which contact may serve to enhance existing, non-primary cues in a phonological contrast by shifting cue distributions, thereby increasing the likelihood that these cues will come to be perceived as prominent and phonologized. © 2023 Ubiquity Press.

It is a challenge, given the complexity of stance and the many other types of meaning that share the same acoustic channels, all overlaid on the lexical and syntactic material of the message. With the goal of identifying automatically-extractable, acoustically-measurable correlates of stance-taking, this work identified signals of stance in prosodic measures of fundamental frequency, intensity, and duration in an audio corpus of dyads engaged in collaborative conversational tasks designed to elicit frequent changes in stance at varying levels of involvement. The study examined over 32,000 stressed vowels in content words spoken by 40 American English-speakers and found that f0 and intensity increased with stance strength, longer vowel duration signaled positive polarity, and a combination of measures distinguished several stance-act types, including: general agreement, weak-positive agreement, rapport-building agreement, reluctance to accept a stance, stance-softening, and backchannels.

Participants were asked to produce coordinated bare noun phrases in response to picture stimuli (e.g., Delfin und Planet, 'dolphin and planet') without any predefined word order. Overall, children and adults preferably produced animate items before inanimate ones, confirming findings of Prat-Sala, Shillcock, and Sorace (2000). In the group of preschoolers, the strength of the animacy effect correlated positively with age. Furthermore, the order of the conjuncts was affected by the rhythmic constraint, such that disrhythmic sequences, i.e., stress lapses, were avoided. In both groups, the latter result was significant when the two stimulus pictures did not vary with respect to animacy. In sum, our findings suggest a stronger influence of animacy compared to rhythmic well-formedness on conjunct ordering for German speaking children and adults, in line with findings by McDonald, Bock, and Kelly (1993) who investigated English speaking adults.

Scholars have observed that the phonetic and phonological details of the pre-nasal vowel among [n]-dialects differ from those of [n]-dialects. The prevailing view in Spanish phonology is that backing and nasalization are part of a more general process of weakening: /n/ goes [n] before going to zero, leaving nasalization 'residue' in the pre-nasal vowel. Despite the well-documented dialectal differences and covariation pressures in anticipatory vowel nasalization, instrumental studies examining Spanish weakening of the nasal consonant together with anticipatory vowel nasalization are scarce. To this end, I compare co-variation between the word-final nasal consonant and anticipatory vowel nasalization in an [n]-dialect and an [n]- one. Twenty-eight speakers from Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and twenty-six from Buenos Aires (Argentina) were recorded with a nasometer. Findings revealed that both dialects are susceptible to covariation pressures. At the same time, despite exhibiting similar degrees of nasal consonant weakening, Santo Domingo Spanish exhibits earlier onset of nasalization nonetheless, suggesting that dialectal differences in the temporal extent of anticipatory vowel nasalization cannot be exclusively ascribed to nasal consonant weakening. © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

In addition, there is a question whether listeners might utilize a normalization procedure during speech perception. This paper reports the results of two studies that explore these questions - with particular focus on vocal tract length normalization. Drawing on research in speech engineering, where accurate estimates of vocal tract length are needed in some approaches to automatic speech recognition and speaker verification, a new model of vowel normalization is introduced. The model uses a direct measure of average formant spacing (the ΔF) which can be used to measure vocal tract length. The acoustic consequences of vocal tract length differences are removed from vowel measurements by scaling vowel formant measurements by ΔF. Study 1 found that this method is comparable to Nearey's (1978) uniform normalization method, while providing an explicit vocal tract length interpretation, and a rationalized unit of measure. Study 2 found that uniform normalization measures (which let each formant serve as a noisy estimator of ΔF) improve vowel classification even with only a couple of randomly selected vowel tokens. This suggests that vocal tract length normalization could be involved in speech perception.

Gestural models of tone provide a natural entry point to linking abstract association with physical realization, but remain underdeveloped. We present the results of two acoustic production studies on two dialects of Serbian, a lexical pitch accent language. In the Belgrade dialect, pitch accents are aligned relatively late in the tone-bearing unit, while in the Valjevo dialect, pitch accents are phonetically retracted, sometimes into the preceding syllable. We varied the phonetic duration of syllable onsets of candidate tone-bearing units in falling (experiment 1) and rising (experiment 2) pitch accents, and measured the effects on the timing of F0 excursions. Consistent interactions between F0 excursions and the segmental content indicate that the phonological system of abstract tone association is the same in both dialects, despite differences in temporal alignment. We argue that this apparent mismatch between association and alignment can be expressed straightforwardly in the Articulatory Phonology framework by allowing tone gestures to coordinate with other gestures in all the ways that segmental gestures can, rather than restricting tone to c-center coordination. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

To answer the question whether disambiguating prosody is produced in a situationally dependent or independent manner and to contribute to our understanding of the nature of the prosody-syntax link, we systematically explored variability in the prosody of boundary productions of coordinates evoked by different contextual settings in a referential communication task. Our analysis focused on prosodic boundaries produced to distinguish sequences with different syntactic structures (i.e., with or without internal grouping of the constituents). In German, these prosodic boundaries are indicated by three major prosodic cues: F0-range, final lengthening, and pause. In line with the Proximity/Anti-Proximity principle of the syntax-prosody model by Kentner and Féry (2013), speakers clearly use all three cues for constituent grouping and prosodically mark groups within and at their right boundary, indicating that prosodic phrasing is not a local phenomenon. Intra-individually, we found a rather stable prosodic pattern across contexts. However, inter-individually speakers differed from each other with respect to the prosodic cue combinations that they (consistently) used to mark the boundaries.

Recent research has argued that saltation is diachronically unstable and documented one possible cause of instability: Learners exposed to saltatory alternations may overgeneralize them to intermediate sounds. However, this research has trained participants to criterion or excluded participants who did not reach criterion accuracy on familiar sounds. In first language acquisition, learners of languages with saltatory patterns cannot hope to receive more exposure to the pattern than those learning non-saltatory patterns. For this reason, we examined learning of saltatory and non-saltatory patterns after a constant amount of training. We compared saltatory labial palatalization to non-saltatory alveolar and velar palatalization. Participants showed overgeneralization of saltatory palatalization in a judgment task. However, saltatory alternations did not result in increased rates of palatalizing similar sounds, compared to non-saltatory alternations. Instead, saltatory alternations were less likely to be produced than non-saltatory alternations. These results suggest that large, saltatory alternations may be diachronically unstable because they are harder to (learn to) produce. Instead of being overgeneralized to intermediate sounds, saltatory alternations may disappear from the language by losing productivity and being replaced with faithful mappings. © 2018 The Author(s).","Language change; Learning; Palatalization; Saltation","","V.

Each talker in a group of Mandarin-English and Korean-English bilinguals was recorded producing simple sentences in each of their languages. The recordings were then presented to native listeners of the language-being-spoken in a test of sentence-in-noise recognition to yield a pair of L1 and L2 intelligibility scores for each talker based on the proportion of words correctly recognized. For all talkers, their L2 speech (i.e., Mandarin- or Korean-accented English) was consistently lower in intelligibility than their L1 speech (i.e., native accented Mandarin or Korean). This dissociation between L1-L2 speech intelligibility was evident in different intelligibility scores at comparable signal-to-noise ratios (as much as 35 percentage points for the Mandarin-English bilinguals) and in the required boost in signal-to-noise ratio to achieve comparable intelligibility (>8-10 dB). Critically, L1 and L2 intelligibility scores within the bilingual talkers were strongly positively correlated: Talkers with relatively high intelligibility in L1 also achieved relatively high intelligibility in L2.

Long high-tone spans result from unbounded leftward spread of either lexical high tones or an intonational high boundary tone. This study investigates whether long tone spans in Luganda differ phonetically in f0 timing or scaling from short tone spans, and whether lexical high tones are implemented differently than intonational ones. In a production study involving 10 Luganda speakers, it was found that the initial f0 rise ends significantly later in long high-tone spans than in short high-tone spans, reflecting the reduced time pressures involved when the f0 rise is in a separate syllable than the f0 fall. The final f0 fall at the end of the span begins earlier in the syllable in long high-tone spans than in short high-tone spans, reflecting the same time pressures. There was no difference in f0 level between long and short high-tone spans, indicating that the time pressure does not lead to undershoot. The intonational high tone has significantly smaller f0 excursions in the initial rise and the final fall, compared to the lexical high tones. © 2018 The Author(s).","Boundary tone; f0; F0 timing; Lexical tone; Time pressure","","S.

Although overall imitation was quite good, native phonological influences, as reflected in Categorised versus Uncategorised assimilation types in a prior perception study with the same participants (Chen, Antoniou, & Best, 2023), constrained non-native tone imitations. Residual perceptual sensitivity to phonetic differences between the target stimuli and native tones, as reflected in percent choice and goodness ratings in assimilation, also affected imitation. Effects of stimulus variability and memory load were restricted and interacted with specific tones for each participant group. Imitations were generally more accurate under low memory load, constant talker and vowel conditions, consistent with a more phonetic mode of perception. Imitation accuracy decreased under high memory load, variable talker and vowel conditions, consistent with a more phonological mode of perception.

The Media Lengua vowel system is unusual in that it incorporates lexical items originating in Spanish's five-vowel system into a three-vowel system inherited from Quichua, resulting in high degrees of overlap between the front versus back, mid and high vowel pairs /e, i/ and /o, u/ in F1xF2 space. As Media Lengua speakers utilize and differentiate between all five vowels despite the large degree of acoustic overlap between mid and high vowels, this raises the question of what other correlates beyond F1 and F2 might be involved. To address this, our study looks at a range of variables, both acoustic and qualitative, in a multi-method approach using both factor analysis for mixed data and linear mixed effects regression modelling. Each method provides a unique view on the correlates of vowel differentiation in Media Lengua. Taken together, our results indicate that Media Lengua speakers rely on both social and linguistic contextual cues to distinguish mid from high vowels, which overlap in acoustic space (F1 and F2).

We first introduce electromagnetic articulography as a method. We then focus on existing data collection practices. Our overview is based on a literature review of 905 publications from a large variety of journals and conferences, identified through a systematic keyword search in Google Scholar. The review shows that experimental designs vary greatly, which in turn may limit researchers' ability to compare results across studies. Finally, we describe an EMA data collection procedure that includes an articulatory-driven strategy for determining where to position sensors on the tongue without causing discomfort to the participant. We also evaluate three approaches for preparing (NDI Wave) EMA sensors reported in the literature with respect to the duration the sensors remain attached to the tongue: 1) attaching out-of-the-box sensors, 2) attaching sensors coated in latex, and 3) attaching sensors coated in latex with an additional latex flap. Results indicate no clear general effect of sensor preparation type on adhesion duration. A subsequent exploratory analysis reveals that sensors with the additional flap tend to adhere for shorter times than the other two types, but that this pattern is inverted for the most posterior tongue sensor. © 2020 The Author(s).

The T3S process changes the first of two consecutive low tones (T3) into a rising tone. It applies obligatorily within a foot and optionally across feet. When T3S is optional, it is more likely to apply to Tone 3 syllables across smaller prosodic boundaries than larger ones; the smaller the boundary, the sharper the T3S pitch rise. Participants listened to twenty-seven structurally ambiguous sentences and identified from two written interpretations the one consistent with what they heard. Each sentence contains two consecutive Tone 3 syllables, and posing different prosodic boundaries between the Tone 3 syllables would result in different interpretations. The first Tone 3 syllable was manipulated into three tone shapes (sharp-rising, shallow-rising, low) and two duration types (long, short). The results show higher major-juncture interpretation rates when the first Tone 3 is long than short, when T3S does not apply than when it applies, and when T3S has a shallower than sharper pitch slope. The tone effect further interacts with the foot formation of Tone 3 syllables in each sentence. We propose that listeners have sophisticated knowledge of prosodic variables and use it efficiently in linguistically meaningful contexts. © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","Open Library of Humanities","18686346","","","","English","Lab.

Therefore, vowel-/l/ coarticulation may increase ambiguity between prelateral vowels. We used a vowel identification task to test the effect of vowel-/l/ coarticulation on vowel disambiguation in perception. Listeners categorized vowels in /hVd/ and /hVl/ contexts. Results showed reduced accuracy of vowels before coda /l/ compared to coda /d/, showing that coda /l/ increases vowel disambiguation difficulty. In particular, reduced perceptual contrast was found for the rime pairs /u:l-ul, æͻl-æl/ and /aul-ͻl/ (e.g., fool-full, howl-Hal, dole-doll). A second experiment tested the effect of reduced perceptual contrast on word recognition. Listeners identified minimal pairs contrasting key vowel pairs in the /CVl/ and /CVd/ contexts. Reduced accuracy and increased response time in /l/ contexts shows that coda /l/ hinders listeners' ability to identify vowels. The implications of reduced perceptual vowel contrast for compensation for coarticulation and sound change are discussed. Copyright: © 2021 The Author(s).

Phonetic work on languages in which onsets participate in categorical weight criteria shows that onsets contribute to stress assignment through their phonetic impact on the nucleus, primarily through their effect on nucleus energy (Gordon, 2005). Onsets in English probabilistically participate in weight-based processes, and here it is predicted that they impact the phonetic realization of the syllable similar to the way that onsets do in languages with categorical onset weight criteria. To test this prediction, speakers in this study produced monosyllabic English words varying in onset complexity, and measures of duration, intensity, and f0 were collected. Results of the current study are consistent with the predictions of Gordon’s perceptual account of categorical weight, showing that integrated intensity of the rime is incapable of driving onset weight behavior in English. Furthermore, results indicate that onsets impact the shape of the intensity envelope in a manner consistent with explanations for gradient onset weight that appeal to onset influence on the perceptual center (Ryan, 2014). Together, these results show that cues to gradient weight act independently of primary cues to categorical weight to probabilistically impact weight sensitive stress assignment in English. © 2020 The Author(s).","Onset complexity; P-center; Production study; Syllable weight","","A.

The current study revisits this conclusion and investigates to what extent speakers of Papuan Malay, a language of Eastern Indonesia, use suprasegmental stress cues to recognize words. Acoustically, this language exhibits predictable word level prominence patterns, which could facilitate word recognition. However, the literature lacks a crucial perceptual verification, and related languages among the Trade Malay varieties have been analyzed as stressless. This could be indicative of either regional variation or different criteria to diagnose word stress. To investigate this issue, the current study reviews the literature on which criteria were decisive to diagnose (the absence of) word stress in Indonesian and Trade Malay. An acoustic analysis and a gating task investigate the usefulness of Papuan Malay suprasegmental stress parameters for word recognition. Results show that Papuan Malay listeners are indeed able to use stress cues to identify words.

They typically play a key role in coordinating speech with co-speech gesture, in coordination with a musical beat, and in other sensorimotor synchronization tasks such as speech-coordinated beat tapping and metronome timing. While various phonological theories have considered stress from both of these perspectives, there is as yet no clear explanation as to how these properties relate to one another. The present work tests the hypothesis that aspects of phonetic enhancement may in fact be driven by coordination itself by observing how phonetic patterns produced by speakers of two prosodically-distinct languages—English and Medumba (Grassfields Bantu)—vary as a function of timing relations with an imaginary metronome beat. Results indicate that production of syllables in time (versus on the ‘offbeat’) with the imaginary beat led to increased duration and first formant frequency—two widely observed correlates of syllable stress—for speakers of both languages. These results support the idea that some patterns of phonetic enhancement may have their roots in coordinative practices. © 2022 The Author(s).","","","K.

The data are drawn from a corpus of field recordings, including roughly 400 utterances produced by 15 speakers from the Trexenta and Western Campidanese areas. Campidanese has a complex lenition system that interacts with length, voicing, and manner contrasts. We show that the semi-automated lenition analysis presented in this journal by Ennever, Meakins, and Round can be fruitfully extended to our corpus, despite its much more heterogeneous set of materials in a genetically distant language. Intensity measurements from this method do not differ qualitatively from more traditional ones in their ability to detect lenition-fortition patterns, but do differ in interactions with stress. Lenition-fortition patterns reveal at least three levels of prosodic constituent in Campidanese, each of which is associated with medial lenition and initial fortition. Lenition affects all consonants and V-V transitions. It reduces duration, increases intensity, and probabilistically affects qualitative manner and voicing features in obstruents. Mediation analysis using regression modeling suggests that some intensity and most qualitative reflexes of lenition are explained by changes in duration, but not vice versa. © 2019 The Author(s).","Campidanese; Campidanian; Consonant manner; Duration; Fortition; Initial strengthening; Intensity; Lenition; Prosodic phrasing; Sardinian","","J.

Earlier models (Johnson, 1997b) suggest all perceived information was stored in memory, whereas more recent proposals (Pierrehumbert, 2002; Goldinger, 2007) suggest some degree of abstraction occurs in storing particular exemplars. Findings from the phonetic accommodation paradigm (Goldinger, 1998; Nielsen, 2011, etc.) suggest that the accumulation of new exemplars may drive the spread of sound change. At the same time, some theories of sound change suggest that perceptual biases serve as a starting point for change (Ohala, 1981, 1983). The current study investigates how perceptual biases, such as the predictability of coarticulation, can shape the contents of exemplars. The experimental results suggest that an expected phonetic alteration, such as f0 raising on vowels following voiceless consonants-a predictable coarticulatory effect-is more likely to undergo some degree of abstraction when stored in exemplar memory, whereas unexpected phonetic detail (e.g., f0 raising following voiced consonants) is more faithfully stored or maintained for longer in memory. These findings suggest perceptual biases that could shape pools of exemplars, leading to different expectations for conditioned versus unconditioned sound changes. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

When speakers interpret effects such as nasalization, glottalization, and rhoticization as an inherent property of a vowel, a new phonological contrast is born. Studying this process directly is challenging because most vowel systems are stable and phonological change likely follows a long transitional period in which coarticulation is conventionalized beyond its mechanical basis. We examine the development of a new vowel feature by focusing on the emergence of rhotic vowels in Kalasha, an endangered Dardic (Indo-Aryan) language, using biomechanical and acoustic modeling to provide a baseline of pure rhotic coarticulation. Several features of the Kalasha rhotic vowel system are not predicted from combining muscle activation for non-rhotic vowels and bunched and retroflex approximants, including that rhotic back vowels are produced with tongue body fronting (shifting the backness contrast to principally a rounding contrast). We find that synthesized vowels that are about 30% plain vowel and 70% rhotic are optimal (i.e., they best approximate observed rhotic vowels and also balance the acoustic separation among rhotic vowels with the separation from their non-rhotic counterparts). Otherwise, dispersion is not generally observed, but the vowel that is most vulnerable to merger differs most from what would be expected from coarticulation alone.  © 2023 The Author(s).","","","J.

Focusing on asymmetries in adaptation to the voicing patterns of English coronal fricatives, we suggest that typology or synchronic experience affect adaptation. A corpus study of coronal fricative substitution patterns confirmed that North American English listeners are more likely to be exposed to devoiced/z/than voiced/s/. Across two perceptual adaptation experiments, listeners in test conditions heard naturally produced devoiced/z/or voiced/s/in critical items within sentences, while control listeners were exposed to identical sentences with canonical pronunciations. Perceptual adaptation was tested via a lexical decision test, with devoiced/z/or voiced/s/, as well as a novel alveopalatalized pronunciation, to determine whether adaptation was targeted in the direction of the exposed variant or reflected a more general relaxation. Results indicate there was directional and word-specific adaptation for/z/-devoicing with no evidence for generalization. Conversely, there was evidence of/s/-voicing generalizing and eliciting general category relaxation. These results underscore the role of perceptual experiences, and support an evaluation stage in perceptual learning, where listeners assess whether to update a representation. © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

We exploit naturally occurring consonant overlap differences between German and Georgian speakers' productions to probe the constraints that language-specific patterns put on the flexibility of cluster articulation. We recorded articulography data from Georgian and German speakers imitating CCV clusters as produced by a German and Georgian audio model, respectively. The German participants adapted their relative overlap towards the Georgian audio model to various degrees depending on whether the cluster was phonotactically familiar to them or not. A higher degree of adaptation was observed for clusters phonotactically illegal in German. Phonotactically legal clusters showed only an intermediate degree of articulatory adaptation, even though acoustically these clusters showed a rather strong move towards the Georgian audio model in terms of the aerodynamics of the interconsonantal transition period. Georgian speakers on the other hand failed to adapt to the German audio model articulatorily and acoustically, possibly because the German cluster inventory is a subset of the Georgian inventory. This means that Georgian speakers can draw on native speaker knowledge for all clusters, which is a factor known to constrain imitation.

Many studies have reported consistent synchronisation of atomic prominence markers across modalities (i.e., pitch accents and gesture apexes). This is prima facie evidence that gesture and prosody are implemented together, and therefore the former can play a role in the identification and perception of the latter through apex-tone synchronisation. However, only few studies considered the full intonational context when investigating synchronisation (e.g., potential alignment of apexes with boundary tones). This is particularly relevant for Turkish as there is disagreement in the literature about whether all words in Turkish bear a pitch accent. In this study, we test the synchronisation of apexes with all intonational events in Turkish natural speech data annotated for gesture and prosody, resulting in 820 gesture apex and 3697 tonal event annotations. The study uses syllable duration (160ms) to determine synchronisation between these anchors via equivalence tests while also integrating gestural and prosodic context as factors that can affect the temporal distance between these units through mixed-effects linear regression. The findings showed that apexes were chiefly synchronised with pitch accents (71%), indicating that prominence was the primary constraint for synchronisation. However, analysis of cases with no prosodic prominence provides the first evidence for a hierarchical constraint on synchronisation, since apexes were preferentially synchronised with the tones marking prosodic words (76%) and not with the markers of prosodic constituents higher in the hierarchy. This finding supports the claim that there may be accentless words in Turkish since the absence of prominence caused a systematic shift in the synchronisation behaviour of apexes. More generally, the study shows how multimodal evidence from gesture can be used in the identification of phonological categories, and that prosodic structure is likely to be expressed through multimodal cues as a composite signal. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","","","Open Library of Humanities","18686346","","","","English","Lab.

The present study used articulatory data from Moroccan Arabic to evaluate whether there were reliable differences in peak velocity or measured stiffness based on primary oral articulator. Evidence for such differences was limited. We also evaluated whether the degree of overlap in clusters could be predicted by the combination of articulators in a C1C2 cluster. Some significant differences were found, but they did not align with the assumed differences in inherent rapidity of the articulators. Lastly, we evaluated whether the amount of overlap was influenced by the relative peak velocities of the closing gestures of two-consonant clusters. It was not. However, when the dynamical control parameter of stiffness of the same closing gestures was used instead of peak velocity, a robust effect on overlap was found. This result suggests that the relative settings of the control parameter of stiffness influence degree of overlap in a cluster, not peak velocity, which is too subject to contextual effects such as movement amplitude. © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

These questions are important to address, since they bear on the general question of how speakers take into account multiple sources of evidence when they make linguistic decisions. Inspired by an accumulating body of research on cumulativity in other linguistic patterns, two experiments on sound symbolism using Pokémon names were conducted with native speakers of English. The experiments tested two types of cumulativity: Counting cumulativity, which holds if the effects of multiple instances of the same factor add up, and ganging-up cumulativity, which holds when the effects of different factors add up. The experiments addressed whether these patterns of cumulativity hold in sound symbolism, and, more importantly, if so, how.

The spliced coda has the opposite effect: Vowels presented with voiced codas are perceived as shorter. To explain what characteristics make vowels produced with voiced codas sound longer than vowels produced with voiceless codas, four experiments tested how acoustic correlates of voicing affect English speakers' perception of vowel duration. Vowels were manipulated in a ten-step duration continuum, and listeners categorized each vowel as 'long' or 'short.' Study 1 tested effects of vowel height categories (/æ, ε, I/) and within-category F1. Study 2 tested effects of intensity contour. Study 3 tested effects of spectral tilt. Perceived vowel duration increased with vowel height and rising intensity. Perceived vowel duration decreased with falling intensity and with higher spectral tilt. There was no effect of within-category F1. Study 4 confirmed that the effect of the original coda environment is not specific to English stimuli. The effects of spectral tilt and intensity contour on perceived duration provide a possible perceptual pathway for the development of voicing-conditioned vowel duration; coda voicing influences these characteristics and they in turn influence perceived vowel duration.

The literature on the subject is still scarce and even the basic description of the process is debated. This study tested the speculation that inconsistencies in the literature may be explained if certain features of denasalization have developed relatively recently as part of an ongoing sound change. Based on apparent-time data from thirty-two speakers of Seoul Korean, the study explored the development of denasalization over a fifty-year period. The phonetic manifestations of domain-initial nasals were examined, along with the effects of prosodic position, place of articulation, and the height of the following vowel. The results revealed that denasalization has advanced rapidly over time, acquiring more plosive-like features of devoicing as well as a complete lack of nasality. Alveolar nasals before a high vowel were most likely to show denasalization and devoicing. Interestingly, the cumulative effect of prosody became weakest and partial denasalization was least likely for the younger group. Based on these results, we speculate that Korean denasalization is in the process of being stabilized into a discrete phrase-level process from a more general, gradient phenomenon of domain-initial strengthening, consistent with the theory of the life cycle of phonological processes. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Applied to rt-MRI data, GAMMs allow for observation of factor effects on vocal tract shape throughout two key dimensions: time (vocal tract change over the temporal course of a speech segment) and space (location of change within the vocal tract). Examples of this method are provided for rt-MRI data collected at a temporal resolution of 20 ms and a spatial resolution of 1.41 mm, for 36 native speakers of German. The rt-MRI data were quantified as 28-point semi-polar-grid aperture functions. Three test cases are provided as a way of observing vocal tract differences between: (1) /a:/ and /i:/, (2) /a:/ and /aI/, and (3) accentuated and unstressed /a:/. The results for each GAMM are independently validated using functional linear mixed models (FLMMs) constructed from data obtained at 20% and 80% of the vowel interval. In each case, the two methods yield similar results. In light of the method similarities, we propose that GAMMs are a robust, powerful, and interpretable method of simultaneously analyzing both temporal and spatial effects in rt-MRI video of speech.

Words typically followed by consonants have been argued to have their final /t/s glottaled more often than words less frequently followed by consonants. This paper includes a number of 'internal' and 'external' predictors in a mixed-effects logistic regression model and has two goals: (1) to replicate the positive correlation of the frequency of occurrence of a word in preconsonantal contexts (its 'contextual frequency') with its rates of t-glottaling in both preconsonantal and prevocalic contexts postulated by Eddington and Channer (2010), and (2) to quantify the factors influencing the likelihood of t-glottaling across word boundaries in Midland American English. The effect of contextual frequency has been confirmed. This result is argued to support a hybrid view of phonological storage and processing, one including both abstract and exemplar representations. T-glottaling has also been found to be negatively correlated with bigram frequency and speech rate deviation, while positively correlated with young age in female speakers. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

This paper examines the question of how variability itself varies across languages and speakers, arguing that differences in extent of variability are also systematic. A classic hypothesis from Dispersion Theory (Lindblom, 1986) posits a relationship between extent of variability and phoneme inventory size, but this has been shown to be inadequate for predicting differences in phonetic variability. I propose an alternative hypothesis, Contrast-Dependent Variation, which considers cue weight of individual phonetic dimensions rather than size of phonemic inventories. This is applied to a case study of Hindi and American English stops and correctly predicts more variability in English stop closure voicing relative to Hindi, but similar amounts of lag time variability in both languages. In addition to these group-level between-language differences, the results demonstrate how patterns of individual speaker differences are language-specific and conditioned by differences in phonological contrast implementation. © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

However, the place of articulation of the resulting nasal is unclear. We used production and perception experiments to determine the contexts which condition neutralization and the place of articulation of the resulting nasal. Analysis of ultrasound data using a dimensionality reduction technique revealed that neutralization in production was dependent on the height of the preceding vowel: The highest vowel /i/ conditioned a consistent, non-structure-preserving neutralization to a fronted velar or palatal nasal; the mid vowel // conditioned an inconsistent, structure-preserving neutralization to [n]; and no neutralization occurred after the low vowel /a/. In contrast, Standard Mandarin controls produced the contrast in all vowel contexts. A follow-up perception experiment confirmed that, consistent with complete neutralization, Shanghai Mandarin listeners failed to distinguish alveolar and velar nasals following /i/. More surprisingly, so did Standard Mandarin listeners, suggesting a near merger of the nasal codas following /i/ in Standard Mandarin.

We also tested the same speakers on their perception of the emerging [k] ~ [g] contrast and found that our participants were able to discriminate the emerging contrast well. We additionally explored the possibility that those speakers who use the new contrast more in production are also better at perceiving it, but we did not observe strong evidence of such a link. Overall, our results indicate that the adoption of the new sound is well advanced in the population we tested, but is still modulated by individual-level factors.

The data come from a laboratory study of read speech with speakers from New York and other regions, a corpus of read speech with speakers from the Pacific Northwest and Northern Cities, and a spontaneous telephone speech corpus.

In particular, this task tested whether judgments of President Barack Obama as sounding 'more' or 'less' black (e.g., Alim & Smitherman, 2012) are sensitive to differences in intonation. Half of critical stimuli featured an L+H∗pitch accent, which occurs more frequently in African American Language than in Mainstream U.S. English (Holliday, 2016). Four stimuli apiece were created from these phrases by making each pitch accent more extreme by semitone-based F0 steps. Seventy-nine listeners rated these stimuli via the question, ""How black does Obama sound here?""Mixed-effects modeling indicated that listeners rated more phonetically extreme L+H∗stimuli as sounding blacker, regardless of listener identity.

Social cognition can also be affected by experimentally induced differences in power. A powerful individual's impression of another tends to show greater consistency with the other person's broad social category, while a powerless individual's impression is more consistent with the specific pieces of information provided about the other person. This study investigated whether sibilant categorization would be influenced by power when the listener is presented with inconsistent sources of information about speaker gender. Participants were experimentally primed for behavior consistent with powerful or powerless individuals. They then completed a forced choice identification task: They saw a visual stimulus (a male or female face) and categorized an auditory stimulus (ranging from 'shy' to 'sigh') as /∫/ or /s/. As expected, participants primed for high power were sensitive to a single cue to gender, while those who received the low power prime were sensitive to both, even if the cues did not match.

Similar to the intelligibility and memory benefits found in previous studies, enhanced acoustic-phonetic cues of the listener-oriented clear speech could improve speech segmentation by statistical learning compared to conversational speech. Yet, it could not be precluded that hyper-articulated clear speech, reported to have less pervasive coarticulation, would result in worse segmentation than conversational speech. We tested these predictions using an artificial language learning paradigm. Listeners who acquired English before age six were played continuous repetitions of the ‘words’ of an artificial language, spoken either clearly or conversationally and presented either in quiet or in noise at a signal-to-noise ratio of +3 or 0 dB SPL. Next, they recognized the artificial words in a two-alternative forced-choice test. Results supported the prediction that clear speech facilitates segmentation by statistical learning more than conversational speech but only in the quiet listening condition. This suggests that listeners can use clear speech acoustic-phonetic enhancements to guide speech processing dependent on domain-general, signal-independent statistical computations. However, there was no clear speech benefit in noise at either signal-to-noise ratio. We discuss possible mechanisms that could explain these results.

Based on acoustic evidence from a production experiment with six Turkish speakers, I argue that such gestural timing produces non-lexical vowels in complex onsets in Turkish-previously described as harmonizing epenthetic vowels (Clements & Sezer, 1982, inter alia). Non-lexical vowels occurred in 88.3% of tokens, and usually resembled [m], failing to undergo vowel harmony. Non-lexical vowels are shorter than underlying vowels, and their F1 and F2 values are more affected by the following vowel, suggesting they are more subject to vowel-to-vowel coarticulation. These results support the hypothesis that the inserted acoustic vowels are targetless, created by timing relations between gestures, with the implication that Turkish phonology does not categorically ban complex onsets. © 2018 The Author(s).","Articulatory Phonology; Complex onsets; Gestural timing; Onset clusters; Turkish; Vowel harmony; Vowel intrusion","","J.

Yet, some individuals are remarkably successful at accurately perceiving non-native sounds (e.g., Bongaerts, van Summeren, Planken, & Schils, 1997). We hypothesize that compact L1 categories give an initial advantage in distinguishing non-native contrasts. Sixty-eight Spanish monolinguals were tested on the degree of compactness of their native category/i/, measured through a goodness-of-fit rating task. Participants listened to synthesized variants of the Spanish/i/vowel (differing in F1, F2, or both) and rated them as either good or bad exemplars of their representation of this category. An individual/i/compactness index was calculated for each participant and related to the individual perceived dissimilarity score for the novel Russian contrast/i-+/. The Russian contrast/i-+/is a problematic contrast to perceive for Spanish speakers due to the absence of/+/in the Spanish vowel inventory, a sound acoustically very similar to/i/.

Target words contained stop-lateral sequences/bl, gl, kl, pl/in word-initial and cross-word contexts and were embedded in carrier phrases with different prosodic boundaries, i.e., no phrase boundary versus an utterance phrase boundary preceded the target word in the case of word-initial clusters, or separated the consonants in the case of cross-word sequences. For word-initial cluster (CCV) onsets, we find that increasing C1 stop duration or the lag between two consonants leads to earlier vowel initiation and reduced local timing stability across CV, CCV. Furthermore, as the inter-consonantal lag increases, C2 duration decreases. In contrast, for cross-word C#CV sequences, increasing inter-consonantal lag does not lead to earlier vowel initiation and robust local timing stability is maintained across CV, C#CV. In other words, in CCV sequences within words, local perturbations to segments have effects that ripple through the rest of the sequence. Instead, in cross-word C#CV sequences, local perturbations stay local. Overall, the findings indicate that the effects of phonetic perturbations on coordination patterns depend on the syllabic organization superimposed on these clusters. © 2022 The Author(s).","","","","","Ubiquity Press","18686346","","","","English","Lab.

The current study investigates how the phonological properties of these alternation processes as well as variation influence how Shanghai speakers represent and access such words. We conducted an auditory-auditory priming lexical decision experiment on Shanghai V-N items that can undergo either tonal extension or tonal reduction with native Shanghai speakers. Each disyllabic target was preceded by monosyllabic primes with the canonical tone, the tonal-extension tone, the surface tone, or a tone unrelated to the tone of the first syllable of the targets. Results showed both canonical and tonal-extension priming effects, but no surface priming effect. Moreover, although more familiar V-Ns were recognized with shorter reaction time, the priming effect did not interact with speakers’ familiarity ratings or sandhi preference ratings of the targets. These data are consistent with the interpretation that both the canonical and tonal-extension forms are represented in Shanghai speakers’ mental lexicon due to tone sandhi variation, but the representation does not seem to be modulated by the frequencies of the variants. Also, together with findings from auditory priming studies of other tone sandhi patterns, the current study suggests that certain phonological properties of an alternation, such as its locality and transparency, influence the representation of words undergoing the alternation; but whether the alternation is structure-preserving does not seem to impact the representation. © 2021 The Author(s).","Phonological variation; Priming; Shanghai Wu; Spoken word recognition; Tone sandhi","","Y.-F.

Three learning outcomes were hypothesized, based on whether learners’ production is shaped mainly by coda complexity, perception of the contrast or L1 dialectal realizations. Data from three reading tasks collected from six learners (three of each L1) and two English-speaking controls were examined using electropalatography (EPG). Linguopalatal contact patterns were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively (presence, absence, and degree of alveolar and velar closures). While difficulty in realizing place contrasts was observed with all L2 speakers, contrary to our hypothesis, the L1 Spanish speakers were less accurate than their Japanese-speaking peers, particularly in the production of word-final prevocalic /ŋ/ for which a high rate of neutralization to /n/ was witnessed. However, the Japanese learners’ greater apparent accuracy was due to the presence of non-target final devoiced epenthetic vowels and/or stop-like releases. Overall, the results provide insights into developmental stages in the acquisition of new positional contrasts, including evidence for first language and even idiolectal influence, and highlight the difficulty of blocking L1 neutralization processes. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","L.

It has recently been claimed that this exposure leads them to create a large protolexicon, consisting of implicit memories of words and word parts, without semantic knowledge. This yields sophisticated phonotactic knowledge (Oh, Todd, Beckner, Hay, King, & Needle, 2020). This claim was supported by two tasks in which Non-Māori-Speaking New Zealanders: (i) Distinguished real words from phonotactically matched non-words, suggesting lexical knowledge; (ii) Gave wellformedness ratings of non-words almost indistinguishable from those of fluent Māori speakers, demonstrating phonotactic knowledge. Oh et al. (2020) ran these tasks on separate participants. While they hypothesised that phonotactic and lexical knowledge derived from the proto-lexicon, they did not establish a direct link between them. We replicate the two tasks, with improved stimuli, on the same set of participants. We find a statistically significant link between the tasks: Participants with a larger proto-lexicon (evidenced by performance in the Word Identification Task) show greater sensitivity to phonotactics in the Wellformedness Rating Task. This extends the previously reported results, increasing the evidence that exposure to a language you do not speak can lead to large-scale implicit knowledge about that language. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","F.

A production study reveals that obstruent voicing has already become optional and that the voicing contrast has been transphonologized into a register contrast based primarily on vowel height (F1). An identification study shows that perception roughly matches production in that F1 is the main perceptual cue associated with the contrast. Structured variation in production suggests a sound change still in progress: While younger speakers largely rely on vowel height to produce the register contrast, older male speakers maintain a variety of secondary properties, including optional closure voicing. Our results shed light on the initial stages of register formation and challenge the claim that register languages must go through a stage in which breathiness or aspiration is the primary contrastive property (Haudricourt, 1965; Wayland & Jongman, 2002; Thurgood, 2002). This article also complements several recent studies about the transphonologization of voicing in typologically diverse languages (Svantesson & House, 2006; Howe, 2017; Coetzee, Beddor, Shedden, Styler, & Wissing, 2018).

This study asks if an eight-way distinction in nuclear tune shape in American English, predicted from the combination of two (monotonal) pitch accents, two phrase accents, and two boundary tones, is evident in speech production and in speech perception. F0 trajectories from a large-scale imitative speech production experiment were analyzed using bottom-up (k-means) clustering, neural net classification, GAMM modeling, and modeling of turning point alignment. Listeners’ perception of the same tunes is tested in a perceptual discrimination task and related to the imitation results. Emergent grouping of tunes in the clustering analysis, and related classification accuracy from the neural net, show a merging of some of the predicted distinctions among tunes whereby tune shapes that vary primarily in the scaling of final f0 are not reliably distinguished. Within five emergent clusters, subtler distinctions among tunes are evident in GAMMs and f0 turning point modeling. Clustering of individual participants’ production data shows a range of partitions of the data, with nearly all participants making a primary distinction between a class of High-Rising and Non-High-Rising tunes, and with up to four secondary distinctions among the non-Rising class. Perception results show a similar pattern, with poor pairwise discrimination for tunes that differ primarily, but by a small degree, in final f0, and highly accurate discrimination when just one member of a pair is in the High-Rising tune class. Together, the results suggest a hierarchy of distinctiveness among nuclear tunes, with a robust distinction based on holistic tune shape and poorly differentiated distinctions between tunes with the same holistic shape but small differences in final f0. The observed distinctions from clustering, classification, and perception analyses align with the tonal specification of a binary pitch accent contrast {H*, L*} and a maximally ternary {H%, M%, L%} boundary tone contrast; the findings do not support distinct tonal specifications for the phrase accent and boundary tone from the AM model. © 2023 The Author(s).","","","J.

A promising route for explanation is the role of social-indexical information in shaping morphological systems. We present a quantitative experimental study on the relationship of morphological perception to speaker gender, a highly salient aspect of the linguistic context that is known to be important in language variation and change. We show that people have significant success in associating English words with speaker gender, and that their implicit knowledge generalizes to gender associations of novel words (pseudowords) on the basis of their component morphemes. By analyzing judgments of morphological decomposition in conjunction with these indexical judgments, we also make inferences about the cognitive architecture for social-indexical effects in morphology. © 2018 The Author(s).","Indexicality; Morphology; Pseudowords; Sociolinguistics","","J.M.

These production data showed that prosodic disambiguation is realized very similarly in the two languages, despite some differences in the degree to which individual juncture cues (e.g., pausing) were favoured. In perception experiments with a new disambiguation task, requiring speeded responses to select the correct meaning for structurally ambiguous sentences, language differences in disambiguation response time appeared: Mandarin speakers correctly disambiguated sentences with earlier juncture faster than those with later juncture, while English speakers showed the reverse. Mandarin speakers also showed higher levels of accuracy in disambiguation compared to English speakers, indicating language-specific differences in the extent to which prosodic cues are used. However, Mandarin, but not English, speakers showed a decrease in accuracy when pausing cues were removed. Thus even with high similarity in both structural ambiguity and production cues, prosodic juncture perception across languages can differ. © 2020 Ubiquity Press.

Listeners sometimes compensate by ascribing these acoustic effects to their source, but the conditions under which they do so have not yet been fully pinpointed. Ohala (1993) had suggested that acoustic effects which are temporally more distant from their source should be more susceptible to misattribution. In three experiments, we tested this hypothesis by varying the temporal extent of coda-triggered coarticulation on vowels and investigating its influence on two different perceptual behaviors: Speaker-model representation and vowel-phoneme identification. Experiment 1 asked listeners to estimate speaker height based on /giC/ and /giC/ nonsense tokens produced by twelve female speakers. Results indicated a gradient effect: Within lax /i/, greater temporal extent of coarticulation correlated with taller height judgments. Experiment 2a was similar, except that temporal extent of coarticulation in the tokens varied across a wider range of values than in Experiment 1. Results again indicated a gradient effect: Within lax /i/, greater temporal extent of coarticulation correlated with taller height judgments. In Experiment 2b, listeners performed an AXB vowel-phoneme discrimination task. Results showed that greater temporal extent of coarticulation correlated with greater likelihood of listeners judging an intended /i/ token to contain the vowel /Λ/. Taken together, our results indicate that temporal extent of coarticulation affects both speaker-models and interpretation of vowel identity. © 2018 The Author(s).","Coarticulation; Perceptual compensation; Sound change; Speaker height perception; Temporal dynamics; Vowel perception","","G.

Participants in experimental conditions were exposed to dependencies affecting stem-suffix pairs of liquids at either a short-range (transvocalic, CVCVLV-LV) or medium-range (beyond-transvocalic, CVLVCV-LV) distance. Two experiments used a poverty of stimulus paradigm, offering no information about the other distance level; participants interpreted short-range interaction as a strictly transvocalic dependency but medium-range interaction as unbounded, generalizing to other distances. Two experiments employed a 'rich stimulus' paradigm, where training data unambiguously indicated the absence of any dependency at the other distance; this enabled probing of specific locality patterns, in particular strictly beyond-transvocalic dependencies. The constraint-based Agreement by Correspondence model of non-adjacent consonant interactions predicts such patterns to be possible for dissimilation but not harmony. The results do not support this hypothesis: Participants seem to have serious difficulty learning strictly beyond-transvocalic dependencies of either kind. Our findings are more consistent with recent proposals that the space of learnable phonotactic restrictions is delimited by the Tier-based Strictly 2-Local class of formal languages. Strictly transvocalic and unbounded dependencies lie within this region, whereas strictly beyond-transvocalic dependencies are more complex, falling outside the learner's hypothesis space. © 2019 The Author(s).

We focus on the dental vs. palatal contrast in this study and test the enhancement-based hypothesis that the dental and palatal sibilants are perceptually less distinct in the [_i] context than in other vowel contexts. This hypothesis is supported by a typological survey of 155 Chinese dialects, which showed that contrastive [si, tsi, tsi] and [i, ti, ti] tend to be avoided even when there are no retroflexes in the sound system. We also conducted a speeded-AX discrimination experiment with 20 English listeners and 10 Chinese listeners to examine the effect of vowels ([_i], [_a], [_ou]) on the perceived distinctiveness of sibilant contrasts ([s-], [ts-t], [ts-t]). The results showed that the [_i] context introduced a longer response time, thus reduced distinctiveness, than other vowels, confirming our hypothesis.

Results of Experiment 1 indicated that amongst the vowel differences described in sociophonetic studies and attested in our stimulus materials, only a small subset caused greater perceptual difficulty for Australian listeners than for the corresponding Australian English vowels. We discuss this perceptual tolerance for vowel variation in terms of how perceptual assimilation of phonetic details into abstract vowel categories may contribute to recognizing words across variable pronunciations. Experiment 2 determined whether short-term multi-talker exposure would facilitate accent adaptation, particularly for those vowels that proved more difficult to categorize in Experiment 1. For each accent separately, participants listened to a pre-test passage in the nonce word accent but told by novel talkers before completing the same task as in Experiment 1. In contrast to previous studies showing rapid adaptation to talker-specific variation, our listeners' subsequent vowel assimilations were largely unaffected by exposure to other talkers' accent-specific variation. © 2018 The Author(s).","English accents; Perceptual Assimilation Model; Perceptual learning; Sociophonetic variation; Vowel perception","","J.A.

We investigated whether the developmental decrease previously attested in anticipatory coarticulation, as well as the relation between coarticulatory degree and the consonantal context, also characterize carryover coarticulation. Sixty-two children and 13 adults, all native speakers of German, were recruited according to five age cohorts: three-year-olds, four-year-olds, five-year-olds, seven-year-olds, and adults. Tongue movements during the production of .CV.C utterances (C = /b, d, g/, V = /i, y, e, a, o, u/) were recorded with ultrasound. We measured vowel-induced horizontal displacement of the tongue dorsum within the last syllable and compared the resulting coarticulatory patterns between age cohorts and consonantal contexts. Results indicate that the degree of vocalic carryover coarticulation decreases with age. Vocalic prominence within an utterance as well as its change across childhood depended on the postvocalic consonant’s articulatory demands for the tongue dorsum (i.e., its coarticulatory resistance): Low resistant /b/ and /g/ allowed for more vocalic perseveration and a continuous decrease, while the highly resistant /d/ displayed lower coarticulation degrees and discontinuous effects. These findings parallel those in anticipation suggesting a similar organization of anticipatory and carryover coarticulation.

This study explores ISIB, considering listener proficiency. According to second language learning theories, the listener's second language proficiency determines the extent to which they rely on their first language phonetics, hence the magnitude of ISIB may be affected by listener proficiency. The accuracy and reaction times of Bulgarian-English bilinguals living in the UK were recorded in a lexical decision task. The English stimuli were produced by native English speakers and Bulgarian-English bilinguals. Listeners responded more slowly and less accurately to the matched-accent stimuli than the native English stimuli. In addition, they adapted their reaction times faster to new speakers with a native English accent compared to a Bulgarian accent. However, the listeners with the lowest English proficiency had no advantage in reaction times and accuracy for either accent. The results offer mixed support for ISIB for Talkers, and are consistent with second language learning theories according to which listeners rely less on their native language phonology when their proficiency in the second language has increased. © 2022 Ubiquity Press.

In this paper we present audiovisual data which confirms two significant facts: (1)/Ɯ/is high, back, and unrounded; and (2) the only vowel produced with lip rounding is/o/. However, the experiment further reveals that the Bora segment traditionally written/∔/is actually not central but rather a possibly novel type of front vowel, articulated with substantial contact between the tongue and both the upper and lower teeth. We use the methodology of Iskarous (2010) to estimate vocal tract area functions for Bora vowels based on their observed formant frequencies and amplitudes. The results of this procedure support our claim that/∔/is front and/Ɯ/is back. Several phonological alternations also motivate this characterization. The opening of the mouth and dental contact visible in the production of/∔/are correlated with its acoustic measurements, albeit in a previously undocumented way.

Findings from a long series of neurolinguistic studies indicate that the effect can be divided into two time windows with different possible brain sources.

However, often it is unclear whether the found effects are due to learning, or due to artefacts of the native language or the artificial language, and whether findings in only one language will generalise to speakers of other languages. The present study offers a new approach to model the influence of both the L1 and the target artificial language on language learning. The idea is to control for linguistic factors of the artificial and the native language by incorporating measures of wordlikeness into the statistical analysis as covariates. To demonstrate the approach, we extend Linzen and Gallagher (2017)’s study on consonant identity pattern to evaluate whether speakers of German and Mandarin rapidly learn the pattern when influences of L1 and the artificial language are accounted for by incorporating measures assessed by analogical and discriminative learning models over the L1 and artificial lexicon. Results show that nonwords are more likely to be accepted as grammatical if they are more similar to the trained artificial lexicon and more different from the L1 and, crucially, the identity effect is still present. The proposed approach is helpful for designing cross-linguistic studies. © 2023 Ubiquity Press. All rights reserved.","","","K.

TLA permits a wide range of two, three, and four-consonant strings within and across word boundaries. Previous descriptive work has suggested that TLA is characterized by widespread, partly optional vowel epenthesis throughout these sequences. We conducted a production study to investigate the phonetic and phonological properties of inter-consonantal intervals (ICIs) in these sequences, including their durations and voicing characteristics, as well as the voicing of surrounding plosive hold phases. Our aim was to assess the extent of ‘variable epenthesis’ and narrow down the range of possible accounts for it. Unlike many previous studies, we did not rely on native speaker intuitions and made minimal use of manual categorical coding, instead focusing on modelling distributions of continuous acoustic parameters. The central question we address is whether our data contain patterns that can only be explained with reference to phonological vowel insertion—given that variable epenthesis can also be accounted for in terms of vocoid intrusion alone (Hall, 2006). Our study improves our understanding of consonant articulations in Arabic, and of epenthesis and related phenomena. © 2019 The Author(s).","Epenthesis; Libyan Arabic; Voicing assimilation; Vowel intrusion","","L.

In production, these robustly generalize to new words and contexts, suggesting that talkers and listeners of a language have internalized them in some form. However, it is unclear whether listeners' knowledge of phonological alternations is used during real-time spoken word recognition. The present study asks whether listeners use knowledge of phonological alternations to modulate activation of competitor forms during real-time word recognition. In two experiments, listeners learned an artificial language with phonological alternations. We then used eye-tracking in the visual world paradigm to assess real-time spoken word recognition. We examined fixations to competitors that would be a match to the input because of the learned phonological alternation. Results showed that listeners do use phonological alternations in real time. Given a [t] ∼ [d] alternation and an auditory stimulus with a surface [d], listeners fixated the [t]-competitor more than one that could not alternate with [d]. They were even able to generalize this to words that had not been learned in their alternated form. However, not all alternations showed the same pattern; listeners did not use a [d] ∼ [z] alternation in the same way. Implications for various models of word recognition are discussed. © 2018 The Author(s).

The first part of the study identifies a number of possible prosodic patterns on qwords as employed in conversational contexts. When they occur in a direct interrogative, qwords are marked with a rise in pitch towards a H(igh) target and a subsequent fall. By contrast, when the qword is embedded, no tonal targets occur on it. The second part consists of a detailed investigation of the alignment and scaling of qwords in utterance-initial position and in narrow focus. While the H target is consistently present somewhere on the qword, neither a local F0 maximum nor a high plateau region is characterized by stable alignment with any specific position in the segmental string. Scaling of the starting point (%L) and endpoint (H) of the rise characteristic of the qword exhibited a dependency on alignment: The rise is somewhat truncated if the peak is aligned early in the word. This study's results shed more light on the intonation system of Tashlhiyt and support earlier findings suggesting that tonal placement in this language is prone to a typologically unusual degree of variability. © 2017 Ubiquity Press Ltd.

Natural speech, in contrast, occurs in a variety of communicative contexts where speakers and hearers dynamically adjust their speech to fit their needs. The present paper demonstrates that phonologically informed analysis of specialized speech registers, such as infant-directed speech, can reveal specific ways segmental and supra-segmental aspects of phonology are modulated dynamically to accommodate the specific communicative needs of speakers and hearers. Data for the analyses come from a corpus of Japanese mothers' spontaneous speech directed to their infant child (infant-directed speech, IDS) and an adult (adult-directed speech, ADS), as well as read speech (RS). The speech samples in the corpus are annotated with segmental, morphological, and intonational information. We will show that the way intonation is exaggerated in Japanese IDS reflects the intonational structure of Japanese, which is different from that of English. We will also demonstrate that rules of phonological grammar, such as devoicing of high vowels and non-high vowels in Japanese, can be differently affected by the needs of the speaker to accommodate the specific characteristics of the listener.","Infant-directed speech; Intonation; Japanese; Speech register; Vowel devoicing","","R.

The primary acoustic correlate of this distinction is the duration of the consonants. Given that the absolute duration of speech sounds varies with speech rate, the question rises to what extent the category boundary between singletons and geminates is sensitive to the overall speech rate (i.e., rate normalization). Next to rate normalization, there are two other possible explanations how singletons and geminates might be distinguished. First, it has been suggested that despite variation in absolute duration, the two categories remain distinct; that is, even in fast speech, geminates seldom take on durations that would be typical of singletons at slow speech rates. Second, it has been suggested that, with higher speech rate, both the duration of consonants and vowels shrink, so that the duration ratio of consonant and adjacent vowel is a rate independent cue for the singleton-geminate distinction. Using production and perception data from Maltese, we show that, first, the singleton-geminate distinction is endangered by speech-rate variation and, second, consequently undergoes speech-rate normalization. © 2018 The Author(s).

Such patterns always involve comparisons between words in the same morphological paradigm (e.g., singular and plural forms with the same stem). The lone exception to this generalization is Ichimura (2006), who argues that a nasal contraction pattern in Japanese is blocked by potential homophony between verbs with different stems. We present experimental evidence that homophony avoidance is not part of the correct synchronic description of the environment in which this pattern applies; rather, nasal contraction does not productively delete stem-final vowels. However, homophony avoidance does appear to affect the probability with which contraction applies. We conclude that homophony avoidance affects phonological behavior, but that absolute homophony-related blocking is restricted to morphological paradigms.","Blocking; Contrast; Homophony; Japanese","","A.

Questions remain about the transferability of this effect to different dialect contexts, and the efficacy of the task in inducing the effect. This paper details an Australian-context experiment modelled on Hay and Drager’s (2010) New Zealand-context stuffed toy study. Seventy-five listeners heard spoken Australian English (AusE) phrases with phrase-final monosyllabic words containing either kit, dress, or trap vowels. Each phrase was followed by audio presentation of a six-step synthesized vowel continuum, from New Zealand English (NZE)-like to exaggerated AusE-like tokens. Listeners attempted to match one of the synthesized variants to the speaker’s realization of the target vowel. Listeners were exposed to one of two priming conditions, established by stuffed toy kiwis (New Zealand) and stuffed toy koalas (Australia), or a control condition (no toy). Contrary to Hay and Drager (2010), token selections did not differ significantly between the New Zealand and Australian priming conditions. However, reversing the order of continuum presentation did significantly affect token selection for kit vowels, raising questions about the task design itself. Results suggest that the influence of regional primes on speech perception may be more limited than previously thought. © 2019 Ubiquity Press.

Japanese listeners also report perceiving the same high vowels between consonant clusters even in the absence of a vocalic segment. Although perceptual vowel epenthesis has been described primarily as a phonotactic repair strategy, where a phonetically minimal vowel is epenthesized by default, few studies have investigated how the predictability of a vowel in a given context affects the choice of epenthetic vowel. The present study uses a forced-choice labeling task to test how sensitive Japanese listeners are to coarticulatory cues of high vowels [i, u] and non-high vowel [a] in devoicing and non-devoicing contexts. Devoicing contexts were further divided into high-predictability contexts, where the phonotactic distribution strongly favors one of the high vowels, and low-predictability contexts, where both high vowels are allowed, to specifically test for the effects of predictability. Results reveal a strong tendency towards [u] epenthesis as previous studies have found, but the results also reveal a sensitivity to coarticulatory cues that override the default [u] epenthesis, particularly in low-predictability contexts. Previous studies have shown that predictability affects phonetic implementation during production, and this study provides evidence predictability has similar effects during perception. © 2019 The Author(s).","Japanese; Perceptual repair; Phonotactics; Recoverability","","J.

Yet obtaining accurate and reliable prosodic annotations for even small datasets is challenging due to the time and expertise required. We discuss several factors that make prosodic annotation diffcult and impact its reliability, all of which relate to variability: in the patterning of prosodic elements (features and structures) as they relate to the linguistic and discourse context, in the acoustic cues for those prosodic elements, and in the parameter values of the cues. We propose two novel methods for prosodic transcription that capture variability as a source of information relevant to the linguistic analysis of prosody. The frst is Rapid Prosody Transcription (RPT), which can be performed by non-experts using a simple set of unary labels to mark prominence and boundaries based on immediate auditory impression. Inter-transcriber variability is used to calculate continuous-valued prosody 'scores' that are assigned to each word and represent the perceptual salience of its prosodic features or structure. RPT can be used to model the relative in?uence of top-down factors and acoustic cues in prosody perception, and to model prosodic variation across many dimensions, including language variety, speech style, or speaker's affect. The second proposed method is the identifcation of individual cues to the contrastive prosodic elements of an utterance. Cue specifcation provides a link between the contrastive symbolic categories of prosodic structures and the continuous-valued parameters in the acoustic signal, and offers a framework for investigating how factors related to the grammatical and situational context in?uence the phonetic form of spoken words and phrases. While cue specifcation as a transcription tool has not yet been explored as RPT has, it has the potential to provide a level of detail that will be useful in modelling systematic context-governed variation in the implementation of prosodic categories, with applications in automatic speech synthesis and recognition, as well as modelling human speech production and perception. We discuss how RPT and cue specifcation, particularly when combined, can improve the effciency and reliability of prosodic transcription and how they can be integrated with expert phonological transcription. © 2016 The Author(s).","","","J.

The analysis serves to highlight the diffculties that spontaneous feldwork data pose for traditional methods of intonational research largely developed for use with controlled speech elicited in the laboratory or under laboratory-like conditions from educated speakers of standardized languages. It leads to proposing a set of principles and procedures which can help deal with the variability inherent in spontaneous data; these principles and procedures apply particularly to data from less homogeneous speech communities but are relevant for the intonation analysis of any linguistic system. This approach relies on the understanding that autosegmental-metrical representations of intonation are phonological representations, not means of faithfully depicting pitch contours per se. It follows that representations should capture what is contrastive in the intonational system under analysis. In turn, this entails that new categories are posited, taking the meaning of tonal events into account and after due consideration of all legitimate sources of phonetic variation. It is argued that following this procedure allows for more robust analyses and is particularly advantageous when data are highly variable. This view is discussed in light of the analysis of Greek Thrace Romani, and in combination with recent proposals for greater uniformity and phonetic transparency in intonational representations, traits which are said to lead to greater insights in typological and cross-varietal research. It is shown that these goals are not better served by a level of broad phonetic transcription which encodes an arbitrary selection of phonetic variants. © 2016 The Author(s).","","","A.

Two cognitive factors, namely clause complexity and boundary depth, were precisely analyzed using statistical models that also accounted for several phonological and syntactic factors.

Lengthening of clause-final particles was affected by boundary depth, while lengthening of the topic marker wa of clauseinitial topic phrases was influenced by clause complexity.

Significant correlations between the production and perception results were observed when by-subject estimates for context-relevant predictors (and their interactions) in the perception regression models were examined in relation to the by-subject estimates of the production regression models.

This adaptation is sensitive not only to speaker social identity but also to implicit social cues, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is automatic rather than controlled. While it has recently been shown that the interpretation of intonation depends on segmental cues to sociolect within the same utterance, the present study explores whether it also depends on implicit contextual social cues. Starting from the observation that a specific type of intonational contour is used differently in Corsican French and Continental French, we tested whether Corsican French listeners interpret this contour differently depending on which dialectal region is evoked by a visual cue. The results are consistent with this hypothesis, thus providing evidence for implicit social adaption in a new domain of linguistic behavior, specifically, the prosody-meaning interface.

We examine to what extent listeners' perception reflects production norms in their local community and, via a reverse matched-guise task, test whether their knowledge of cross-dialectal variability plays an active role in the way they categorize the contrast. While perception appears to reflect production norms on a broad level, we found age-related differences in perception, even for listener groups who showed no sign of a parallel difference in production.

Unaccusative verbs in Spanish are said to be more likely to be subject final (VS order) than unergative verbs, while in languages like English, this is marked with stress shift (i.e., Sv, caps show the nuclear stress). It has long been contended, however, that the semantic factors underlying split intransitivity actually affect information structure, rather than syntax directly. If so, then the effect of verbal semantics on word ordering/nuclear stress placement should be able to be overridden by information structure. Venezuelan Spanish speakers described pictures using a printed unaccusative or unergative verb in response to a question manipulating the information structure type of the subject, i.e., broad focus, theme, QUD-focus, or contrastive focus. Results showed that QUD-and contrastively focused subjects were more likely to carry nuclear stress. Subject stress was also more likely for unaccusatives, but this effect was weaker. Overall stress shift was much more frequent than subject final placement, with neither information structure type nor verb type affecting the likelihood of either response type. These results raise challenges for standard assumptions about the relationship between information structure and unaccusativity, and between final subject placement and stress shift. © 2018 The Author(s).

The factors that condition this innovation are unclear due to collinearity between various boundary phenomena. The right edge of phrasal prosodic categories may be associated with boundary tones, final lengthening, and pause; consequently, the variable presence of [] appears to be affected by prosodic boundary strength, segmental duration, and the presence and duration of a following pause. These factors are teased apart through analysis of an elicitation task from 30 northern speakers, which reveals that [ŋ] clusters are conditioned most strongly by pause. Post-nasal []-presence is only licensed when the following consonant-initial word is temporally distant, showing only minimal sensitivity to prosodic boundaries directly. The surface effect of segmental duration arises only indirectly through its collinearity with pause duration. Current theoretical approaches to external sandhi emphasize a range of different factors, including phonological representations of prosodic constituency, phonetic parameters like segmental duration, and psycholinguistic mechanisms of production planning. This paper provides quantitative evidence from an under-reported feature of northern English that bears directly on these debates. © 2019 The Author(s).","Boundary; Dialects of English; Duration; External sandhi; Lenition; Pause; Prosody; Variation; Velar nasal plus","","G.

Onomatopoeic ideophones represent sounds in the external world by linguistic sounds. To do so effectively requires taking whatever phonological and phonotactic liberties are needed. This predicts that (a) onomatopoeic ideophones will show great diversity in harmony patterns and, in contrast, (b) cross-modal ideophones that capture sensory imagery by using more abstract iconic mappings (Dingemanse et al., 2016) will have more 'room' to conform to vowel harmony. To test these hypotheses, the distribution of harmony patterns in onomatopoeic vs. cross-modal ideophones was examined, using a written corpus of Korean ideophonic stems.

In the present study, we ask whether perceptual learning — a process by which listeners adapt to novel pronunciations — is modulated by listeners’ social preferences. To this end, we use a novel accent exhibiting a back vowel lowering chain shift in pleasant and unpleasant conditions in a lexically guided perceptual learning paradigm to test whether listeners adapt less to the unpleasant guise. Experiment 1 confirms that listeners disprefer the unpleasant guise. Using a lexical decision task as a measure of lexical adaptation, Experiment 2 indicates that listeners in the pleasant and unpleasant guises learned the back vowel shift compared to listeners in a control group. These results suggest that exposure to a voice with lower social prestige does not inhibit lexical adaptation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Adaptation; Lexical decision; Perceptual learning; Priming; Voice evaluation","","M.

Yet, an explicit test of this defnition is lacking, and natural language patterning suggests that word meaning could also act as a cue to word-type status. This possibility was tested in a statistical phonotactic learning experiment in which phonological and semantic properties of word-types varied. During familiarization, the learning targets-wordmedial consonant sequences-were instantiated either by four related word-types or by just one word-type (the experimental frequency factor). The expectation was that more word-types would lead participants to generalize the target sequences. Regarding semantic cues, related word-types were either associated with different referents or all with a single referent. Regarding phonological cues, related word-types differed from each other by one, two, or more phonemes. At test, participants rated novel wordforms for their similarity to the familiarization words. When participants heard four related word-types, they gave higher ratings to test words with the same consonant sequences, irrespective of the phonological and semantic manipulations.

Seoul Korean aspirated stops are differentiated from stops of other phonation types by at least two distinct acoustic properties, stop VOT and f0 of the post-stop vowel, with the latter being the primary cue. In the imitation experiment, Seoul Korean speakers heard and shadowed model speech that contained aspirated stops manipulated by either raising post-stop f0 or lengthening VOT. Their realization of these properties in /t/, /t/, and /t*/ productions were compared before, during, and after exposure. Although both high f0 and long VOT induced imitative changes in post-shadowing productions, the results revealed that exposure to an enhanced non-primary cue (long VOT) also influences the production of the primary cue for aspirated stops (post-stop f0). However, an enhanced primary cue (high f0) does not have similar effects on the non-primary cue. These results provide evidence that spontaneous imitation is not strictly tied to individual phonetic properties but it is rather phonological in that abstract categories are involved in the process of imitation. © 2019 The Author(s).","Aspirated stop; Cue primacy; Phonological imitation; Seoul Korean; Spontaneous imitation","","H.

We analyzed articulatory timing patterns for nine ET patients with activated and inactivated DBS and compared them to a group of healthy age-matched controls. We focused on timing patterns among gestures in syllables with low and high complexity in natural sentence production (simple CV versus complex CCV syllables). These articulatory patterns were interpreted in the framework of a coupled oscillator planning model of speech timing. In simple CV syllables, ET patients did show a similar coordination pattern to healthy control speakers. However, when complexity increased, the patients showed deviant coordination patterns for complex CCV syllables. These deviant patterns even aggravated under activated stimulation. We were able to show that the behavior of the speech system changes when the stimulation was activated, inducing a change in the dynamical system the ET patients have to adapt to. We conclude that coordination problems are not categorical but gradient in nature, pointing to the fact that there are dynamic mechanisms of regulation behind phonetic realization of phonological syllable parses. © 2019 The Author(s).","Deep Brain Stimulation; Dynamical disease; Essential Tremor; Inefficient coordination patterns; Syllable coordination patterns","","A.

Our empirical focus is the perception of plain, ejective, and implosive stops. Drawing on an AX discrimination task, a corpus of spoken Kaqchikel, and a text corpus, we make two claims. First, we argue that speech perception is mediated by phonemic representations which include acoustic detail drawn from prior phonetic experience, as in Exemplar Theory. Second, segmental distributions also condition speech perception: The perceptual distinctiveness of a pair of phonemes is affected by their functional load and relative contextual predictability. These top-down factors influence phoneme discrimination even at relatively fast response times. We take this result as evidence that distributional factors like functional load may affect speech perception by shaping perceptual tuning during linguistic development. This study replicates and extends some key findings in speech perception in the context of a language (Kaqchikel) which is structurally and sociolinguistically different from the majority languages (like English) which have served as the basis of most work in the speech perception literature. At the practical level our research illustrates methods for conducting corpus-based laboratory phonology with lesser-studied and under-resourced languages. © 2018 The Author(s).

The nature of this effect, however, remains controversial. Previous analyses alternately analyzed the variation as darkening or lightening, and alternately found evidence that the variation involves a categorical distinction between allophones or a gradient scale conditioned by phonetic factors. We argue that these diverging conclusions are a result of the numerous factors influencing /l/ darkness and differences between studies in terms of which factors are considered. By controlling for a range of factors, our study demonstrates a pattern of variability that has not been shown in previous work. We find evidence of morpheme-final darkening and morpheme-initial lightening when compared to a baseline of morpheme-internal /l/. We also find segmental effects such that, in segmental contexts which independently darken /l/, one can observe /l/ lightening, and contexts which independently lighten /l/ can make lightening effects undetectable. Morphological and prosodic effects are hence sometimes trumped by segmental context. Once contextual effects are controlled for, there is evidence both for morphologically-conditioned /l/-darkening and for morphologically-conditioned /l/-lightening, both of which can be understood as a result of prosodic differences reflecting morphological junctures.

For example, loanwords from te reo Māori to New Zealand English (NZE) are sometimes pronounced with native rhotic sounds (e.g., ko[]u and ma[]ae) and sometimes with non-native rhotic sounds (e.g., ko[]u and ma[]ae). This study aims to explore the relationship between the selection of a variant in loanword phonology and situation-specific sociolinguistic factors such as topic in speech and cultural images. Additionally, we explore the effects of speaker- and word-specific sociolinguistic factors on the likelihood of choosing a variant. In order to explore these effects, a set of two experiments was conducted, and the results demonstrate that the selection of a variant in NZE loanword phonology is influenced by some sociolinguistic factors. It is argued that these findings can be encapsulated by an exemplar-based approach. More specifically, they can be neatly captured by positing that exemplars with native sounds and those with non-native sounds are represented in the cognitive system of a borrower and updated on the basis of linguistic experience, and exemplars with non-native sounds are stored in relation to a social category associated with the source language and its culture. © 2019 The Author(s).

There is, however, less work on the quality of the illusory vowel. Recently, it has been claimed that the quality of the illusory vowel is also modulated by the phonology of the language, and that the phenomenon of illusory vowels can be understood as a result of the listener reverse inferring the best parse of the underlying representation given their native language phonology and the acoustics of the input stream (Durvasula & Kahng, 2015). The view predicts that listeners are likely to hear different illusory vowels in different phonological contexts. In support of this prediction, we show through two perceptual experiments that Mandarin Chinese speakers (but not American English speakers) perceive different illusory vowels in different phonotactic contexts. Specifically, when presented with phonotactically illegal alveopalatal coda consonants, Mandarin speakers perceived an illusory/i/, but in illegal alveolar stop coda contexts, they perceived a/e/. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, in many dialects of Spanish, word-fnal pre-vocalic consonants ('derived onsets') pattern phonologically with canonical codas and distinctly from canonical onsets. This property of derived onsets has been the subject of much interest in the phonological literature, and has led some linguists to question whether resyllabifcation indeed applies in all Spanish dialects. In this paper, we evaluate evidence for resyllabifcation based on acoustic data from 11 speakers of Peninsular Spanish. The results show that word-fnal pre-vocalic /s/ has increased duration compared to coda /s/, but at the same time, it is shorter compared to word-initial or word-medial pre-vocalic /s/. This result challenges an analysis where derived onsets become phonologically indistinguishable from canonical onsets.

As in other speech sound domains, analyzing intonation involves mapping continuously variable physical parameters to categories. The categories of intonation are organized in a set of relations and rule-governed distributions that defne the intonation system of a language. From physical realizations, as shown by pitch tracks, surface or phonetic tonal patterns can be identifed in terms of tonal targets. Whether surface patterns correspond or not to categories within a given intonation system requires looking at their distributions and contrastiveness. In this paper, I assume the view that a transcription is an analysis of the intonation system, which ultimately aims to identify the contrastive intonation categories of a given language and establish how they signal meaning. Under this view, it is crucial to discuss the ways surface pitch patterns and structural pitch patterns (or phonological categories) are related. Given that intonational analysis is driven by system-internal considerations and that cues to a given category can vary across languages, it is also important to address the issue of how a language-specifc transcription can be reconciled with the need and ability to do cross-language comparison of intonation. Bearing on these two issues, I discuss surface and structure in intonational analysis, drawing on mismatches between (dis)similarities in the phonetics and phonology of pitch contours, across languages and language varieties. © 2016 The Author(s).","Calling contour; Contrastiveness; Distribution; Focus contour; intonation categories; Intonation transcription; Sound-meaning relation; Tone alignment; Tone scaling","","S.

However, there are claims that it is not aerodynamically possible to open the velum for nasalization while maintaining frication noise. We present aerodynamic data from 14 native Scottish Gaelic speakers to determine how the posited nasalized fricatives in this language are realized. Most tokens demonstrate loss of nasalization, but nasalization does occur in some contexts without aerodynamic conflict, e.g., nasalization with the consonant realized as an approximant, nasalization of [h], nasalization on the preceding vowel, or sequential frication and nasalization. Furthermore, a very few tokens do contain simultaneous nasalization and frication with a tradeoff in airflow. We also present perceptual evidence showing that Gaelic listeners can hear this distinction slightly better than chance. Thus, instrumental data from one of the few languages in the world described as having nasalized fricatives confirms that the claimed sounds are not made by producing strong nasalization concurrently with clear frication noise. Furthermore, although speakers most often neutralize the nasalization, when they maintain it, they do so through a variety of phonetic mechanisms, even within a single language.","Airflow; Gaelic; Nasalization; Nasalized fricatives; Perception","","N.

The current study examines how the seemingly successful perceptual identification of voicing varies across stimulus items recorded in reading vs. non-reading procedures and with and without full minimal pairs present in the experimental list. Results of a series of identification tasks reveal that Russian listeners' identification responses are more in line with underlying voicing for the stimuli recorded during word-reading and with minimal pairs included among the experimental items. This shows that voicing judgments are strongly influenced by the acoustic differences produced when speakers encounter orthographic forms or lexical competition. At the same time, perceptual neutralization is also not complete for the items recorded without such exposure, which indicates that listeners' ability to recover underlying voicing is not limited to the production contexts involving written forms or minimal pairs.","Devoicing; Lexical competition; Orthography; Perception; Russian","","V.

In this study, we examine the timecourse of word recognition to test whether glottalization facilitates the perception of words ending in voiceless/t/and/p/, which is expected if glottalization is in fact enhancing. Sixty American English listeners participated in an eye-tracking study, where they heard resynthesized glottalized and non-glottalized versions of CVC English words ending in/p, t, b, d/while looking at a display with two words presented orthographically. Target words were presented with a minimal pair differing in place of articulation (e.g., cop-cot), or voicing, (e.g., bat-bad, cap-cab). Although there is little evidence that glottalization facilitates recognition of words ending in/t/or/p/, there is a strong inhibitory effect: Words ending in voiced stops are recognized more slowly and poorly when the preceding vowel was glottalized. These findings lend little support to a listener-driven, enhancement-based explanation for the occurrence of coda glottalization in American English. On the other hand, they suggest that glottalized instances of coda/t/and/p/, but not of coda/d/and/b/, are perceived as equally good variants of these sounds. © 2018 The Author(s).

When reading sentences out loud, participants' pronunciations of 4 near-minimal pairs of pre-existing lexical items (e.g., Eston[ie] vs. pneumon[je]) exhibit significant differences when acoustically measured, confirming the presence of a [j]-[i] distinction. This distinction is also found to be productively extended to the production of 20 near-minimal pairs of nonce words (e.g., Súmia → [sumie] vs. Fímya → [fimje]), diversified and balanced along different phonologically relevant factors of the surrounding environment. Multiple acoustic measurements are compared to test what aspects most consistently convey the distinction: F2 (frontness), F1 (height), intensity, vocalic sequence duration, transition earliness, and transition speed. This serves the purpose of documenting the distinction's acoustic phonetic realization. It also serves in the comparison of phonological representations. Multiple types of previously proposed phonological representations are considered along with the competing predictions they generate regarding the acoustic measurements performed. Results suggest that the primary and most consistent characteristic of the distinction is earliness of transition into the following vowel, with results also suggesting that the [j] glide has a greater degree of constriction. The [j] glide is found to have a significantly less anterior articulation, challenging the application of a representation based on place or articulator differences that would predict [j] to be more anterior. © 2018 The Author(s).

Co-registered articulatory data (degree of nasalization, tongue height, breathiness) and acoustic data (F1 frequency) related to the productions of phonemic oral and nasal vowels of Southern French were first collected from four native speakers, and the acoustic recordings were subsequently presented to nine Australian English naïve listeners, who were instructed to imitate the native productions. During these imitations, similar articulatory and acoustic data were collected in order to compare the articulatory strategies used by the two groups. The results suggest that the imitators successfully reproduced the acoustic distinctions made by the native speakers, but that they did so using different articulatory strategies. The articulatory strategies for the vowel pair /ᾶ /-/a/ suggest that listeners (at least partially) misperceived F1-lowering due to nasalization and breathiness as being due to tongue height. Additional evidence supports perceptual cue re-weighting, in that the naïve imitators employed nasalance less, and tongue height more, in order to obtain the same F1 nasal-oral distinctions that the native speakers had originally produced. © 2018 Ubiquity Press.

This contribution inventorizes a number of cases of overanalysis and underanalysis in MAE-ToBI and argues that they are in large part due to the decision by Pierrehumbert (1980) to analyze a rising-falling accent as a rising pitch accent (L+H∗) followed by a L-tone from a different source (an 'on-ramp' analysis). It is shown how the opposite choice, a falling pitch accent preceded by a L-tone from a different source (an 'off-ramp' analysis), avoids most of these problems. Results from a perception experiment testing MAE-ToBI's prediction of intonational boundaries show that steep falls do not always signal a boundary. The inclusion of a tritonal prenuclear pitch accent, which explains the absence of an intonational boundary after a steep fall followed by a gradual rise, can readily be accommodated in the 'off-ramp' analysis, but not in MAE-ToBI. © 2016 The Author(s).","English; intonational annotation; intonational phonology; intonational phrasing; ToBI","","C.

In the models we are concerned with here, these categories have the status of phonological units (phonological form), bridging the intrinsic variability of the speech signal (substance) with the intrinsic fuzziness of post-lexical function (meaning). This, together with the relatively small size of the label inventory, precludes a one-to-one relationship between form and substance, and/or between form and function. A Neapolitan Italian corpus of read speech is used to investigate the distributional properties of two pitch accents that have been studied extensively with respect to substance (the alignment of F0 peaks) and meaning (sentence modality). Although there is a general consensus that peaks in this variety are aligned earlier in declaratives than in interrogatives, evidence is provided of contexts in which the converse is true, i.e., in which interrogative peaks are even earlier than their declarative counterparts. In this respect, interrogatives have a richer internal structure than declaratives. We argue that differences in how variably a prosodic category is encoded can be dealt with in an intonation transcription system, as long as this system relates phonological form (the choice of pitch accent in this case) both to phonetic substance and to meaning in a transparent way. © 2016 The Author(s).","","","F.

What causes a language to preserve and lengthen some consonants but shorten and delete others? I show that the typology of consonant duration and occasional deletion in American English is affected by consonants' informativity - their average local predictability. Informativity can explain why usually-predictable segments such as American English /t/are likely to be reduced even when they are locally unpredictable, but usually-predictable segments are preserved even when they are redundant. I use four corpus studies to demonstrate that higher informativity leads to longer duration and reduced likelihood to delete even when other important factors such as the phonetic features, frequency, and local predictability of consonants are controlled for. The role of informativity in the duration and deletion rates of consonants can bridge the gap between phonetic performance and the actuation of phonological processes.","Consonant deletion; Consonant duration; Information theory; Informativity; Performance","","U.C.

Results are presented from an immediate serial recall (ISR) study, designed to determine the relative effects of L1 morphology and orthography on the recall of consonants versus vowels. Forty-five speakers of English, Amharic, and Arabic completed an ISR experiment testing the differential recall of these two segment types. English speakers remembered sequences of syllables in which the consonant is held constant and the vowel changes (e.g., “ma mi mu …”) better than sequences in which the vowel is held constant and the consonant changes (e.g., “ka ma za …”), whereas Arabic speakers remembered both types of sequences equally well, replicating findings from Kissling (2012). Crucially, Amharic speakers in this study performed similarly to Arabic speakers, remembering both sequence types with equal accuracy. Given that Amharic and Arabic share a templatic morphological system, this new result suggests that the morphophonology of a listener's L1 impacts ISR. English and Amharic share similar orthographic systems; the mean accuracies of English and Amharic speakers were significantly different, and it therefore appears that orthography of the L1 does not affect recall accuracy. The results have implications for the role of the morphophonology of a given speaker's L1 in ISR and in speech processing more generally. © 2019 The Author(s).

Participants were speakers of a number of closely related dialects and languages from the coastal area of the Netherlands and North-West Germany, covering Zeelandic Dutch, Hollandic Dutch, West Frisian, Dutch Low Saxon, German Low Saxon, and Northern High German. Our findings suggest that in no variety is the timing of the nuclear peak or the end of the fall systematically affected by the location of the final word boundary or that of the following stress. In most cases, the accentual peak was found to be stably aligned with the beginning of the nuclear accented syllable, while the end of the fall occurred at a fairly constant distance from the preceding F0 peak. These findings do not support a representation of the nuclear fall by a sequence of a high accentual tone and a 'phrase accent' that is secondarily associated to a postnuclear stress. In addition, we found substantial cross-linguistic variation in the overall timing of the beginning and end of the fall. One component in this variation is a geographically gradient shift in the alignment of the pitch gesture.","","","J.

One of the methods frequently used to measure convergence is the difference-in-difference (DID) approach, comparing change in absolute distance between a subject and an interlocutor or model talker. We show that this approach is not a reliable measure of convergence when the starting values of the subject and the interlocutor or model talker are close, which can result in the measurement of apparent divergence, while extreme starting points can result in overestimation of convergence. These biases are of particular concern in studies that look for individual differences in convergence. We propose an alternative approach, linear combination, which does not have the same biases, and demonstrate the advantages of this method using data from convergence studies of four linguistic characteristics and simulated data. © 2019 The Author(s).

The languages studied are English (three places of articulation /p t k/), the Indonesian language Makasar (four places /p t c k/), and the Central Australian languages Pitjantjatjara, Warlpiri (both five places /p t t c k/), and Arrernte (six places /p t t t c k/). We find that languages differ in how they manifest stress on the consonant, with Makasar not showing any effect of stress at all, and Warlpiri showing an effect on burst duration, but not on the spectral measures. For the other languages, the velar /k/ has a ""darker"" quality (i.e., lower spectral centre of gravity), and/or a less diffuse spectrum (i.e., lower standard deviation) under stress; while the alveolar /t/ has a ""lighter"" quality under stress. In addition, the dental /t/ has a more diffuse spectrum under stress. We suggest that this involves enhancement of the features [grave] and [diffuse] under stress, with velars being [+grave] and [-diffuse], alveolars being [-grave], and dentals being [+diffuse]. We discuss the various possible spectral effects of enhancement of these features. Finally, in the languages with five or six places of articulation, the stop burst is longer only for the palatal /c/ and the velar /k/, which have intrinsically long burst durations, and not for the anterior coronals /t t t/, which have intrinsically short burst durations. We suggest that in these systems, [burst duration] is a feature that separates these two groups of consonants. © 2016 The Author(s).","Acoustic features; Articulatory prosody; Australian languages; Indonesian languages; Stop bursts","","M.

These so-called ‘researcher degrees of freedom’ (Simmons, Nelson, & Simonsohn, 2011) can affect the results and the conclusions researchers draw from it. It is argued that phonetic research faces a large number of researcher degrees of freedom due to its scientific object—speech—being inherently multidimensional and exhibiting complex interactions between multiple covariates. A Type-I error simulation is presented that demonstrates the severe inflation of false positives when exploring researcher degrees of freedom. It is argued that combined with common cognitive fallacies, exploitation of researcher degrees of freedom introduces strong bias and poses a serious challenge to quantitative phonetics as an empirical science. This paper discusses potential remedies for this problem including adjusting the threshold for significance; drawing a clear line between confirmatory and exploratory analyses via preregistration; open, honest, and transparent practices in communicating data analytical decisions; and direct replications. © 2019 The Author(s).","False positive; Methodology; Preregistration; Replication; Reproducibility; Speech production; Statistical analysis","","T.B.

In an acoustic study, the influence of stop type, speaker age, and variety on the production of pre- and post-aspiration was analyzed in isolated words produced by 24 speakers of a Western and 24 of an Eastern variety, both divided into two age groups. The results confrmed previous fndings of a sound change from pre- to post-aspiration in both varieties. Velar stops showed the longest, bilabials the shortest, and dental stops intermediate pre- and post-aspiration durations. The observed universal VOTpattern was not found for younger Western Andalusian speakers who showed a particularly long VOT in /st/-sequences. A perception experiment with the same subjects as listeners showed that post-aspiration was used as a cue for distinguishing the minimal pair /pata/-/pasta/ by almost all listeners. Production-perception comparisons suggested a relationship between production and perception: subjects who produced long post-aspiration were also more sensitive to this cue. In sum, the results suggest that the sound change has frst been actuated in the dental context, possibly due to a higher perceptual prominence of post-aspiration in this context, and that post-aspirated stops in Andalusian Spanish are on their way to being phonologized. © 2016 The Author(s).","/s/-aspiration; Andalusian Spanish; Post-aspiration; Pre-aspiration; Sound change","","H.

Meanwhile, within speech directed towards adults, phonetic variation is conditioned by word properties: lower word frequency and higher phonological neighborhood density (ND) correlate with increased hyperarticulation and degree of coarticulation. Both of these types of findings have interpretations that recruit listener-directed motivations, suggesting that talkers modify their speech in an effort to enhance the perceptibility of the speech signal. In that vein, the present study examines lexically-conditioned variation in infant-directed speech. Specifically, we predict that the adult-reported age at which a word was learned - lexical age-of-acquisition (AoA) - conditions phonetic variation in infant-directed speech. This prediction is indeed borne out in spontaneous infant-directed speech: later-acquired words are produced with more hyperarticulated vowels and a greater degree of nasal coarticulation. Meanwhile, ND predicts phonetic variation in data from spontaneous adultdirected speech, while AoA does not independently influence production. The patterns of findings in the current study support the stance that evaluation of the need for clarity is tuned to the listener. Lexical difficulty is evaluated by AoA in infant-directed speech, while ND is most relevant in adult-directed speech.","Coarticulation; Infant-directed speech; Lexical effects; Speech production","","G.

Perception of rhythmic properties may rely on cognitive networks that are shared between the two domains. If so, then variability in speech rhythm perception may relate to individual differences in musicality. To examine this possibility, the present study focuses on rhythmic grouping, which is assumed to be guided by a domain-general principle, the Iambic/Trochaic law, stating that sounds alternating in intensity are grouped as strong-weak, and sounds alternating in duration are grouped as weak-strong. German listeners completed a grouping task: They heard streams of syllables alternating in intensity, duration, or neither, and had to indicate whether they perceived a strong-weak or weak-strong pattern. Moreover, their music perception abilities were measured, and they filled out a questionnaire reporting their productive musical experience. Results showed that better musical rhythm perception ability was associated with more consistent rhythmic grouping of speech, while melody perception ability and productive musical experience were not. This suggests shared cognitive procedures in the perception of rhythm in music and speech. Also, the results highlight the relevance of considering individual differences in musicality when aiming to explain variability in prosody perception. © 2017 The Author(s).","Domain-general; German; Grouping; Iambic/Trochaic law; Musical ability; Musicality; Prosody; Rhythm; Speech; Speech perception","","N.

Workers recruited in a crowdsourcing marketplace, because of their varying levels of commitment and education, make more mistakes than workers in a controlled laboratory setting. Methods for compensating transcriber mistakes are desirable because, with such methods available, crowdsourcing has the potential to significantly increase the scale of experiments in laboratory phonology. This paper provides a brief tutorial on statistical learning theory, introducing the relationship between dataset size and estimation error, then presents a theoretical description and preliminary results for two new methods that control labeler error in laboratory phonology experiments. First, we discuss the method of crowdsourcing over error-correcting codes. In the error-correcting-code method, each difficult labeling task is first factored, by the experimenter, into the product of several easy labeling tasks (typically binary). Factoring increases the total number of tasks, nevertheless it results in faster completion and higher accuracy, because workers unable to perform the difficult task may be able to meaningfully contribute to the solution of each easy task. Second, we discuss the use of explicit mathematical models of the errors made by a worker in the crowd. In particular, we introduce the method of mismatched crowdsourcing, in which workers transcribe a language they do not understand, and an explicit mathematical model of second-language phoneme perception is used to learn and then compensate their transcription errors. Though introduced as technologies that increase the scale of phonology experiments, both methods have implications beyond increased scale. The method of easy questions permits us to probe the perception, by untrained listeners, of complicated phonological models; examples are provided from the prosody of English and Hindi. The method of mismatched crowdsourcing permits us to probe, in more detail than ever before, the perception of phonetic categories by listeners with a different phonological system.","Crowdsourcing; Rapid prosody transcription; Second-language phonology; Statistical learning theory","","M.
